Alien Mouth was started in 2015 in Bryan, Texas. 

Alien Mouth exists to publish and promote exciting poetry that moves with, in, and among those it touches. It is where contact is made, where frontiers multiply and understanding complicates. We believe in art, especially literature, that makes visible the strange, hidden, beautiful, and fucked up parts of being alive. 
 
We publish work by and for everyone, but our mission has always been to publish work that centers the voices and experiences of the marginalized.
