            So what you were caught crying at work. So what </br>
            you wrote it down even though you would never </br>
            want to remember it. Everything needs salt. Even </br>
            us. Even when we don't. You didn't hear this from </br>
            me, but I didn't leave my home for two years. I </br>
            discovered a new species of dust mite. I trained </br>

            be the one with a fish in my hands, telling </br>
            everyone I'm the wrong kind of body for this. You </br>
            can't miss me.</br>
