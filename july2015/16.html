            <p><b>Two Poems by Beyza Ozer</b></p>
            <b>You Remind Me Of A Sound Like Brushing Hair</b></br></br>
            Has anyone died by</br>
            watching things sit</br>
            on water? By skipping</br>
            a flat rock across water?</br>
            Or trying to sit on water?</br>
            We are not birds.</br>
            Has anyone died before</br>
            seeing beautiful things</br>
            on the surface of a lake?</br>
            You. Did you at least get</br>
            a chance to look at the</br> 
            clouds? Those balloons</br>
            won't hold very long.</br>
            You don't need oxygen</br>
            after passing the first</br>
            atmosphere. The balloon</br>
            will pop and you'll be</br>
            Up There, waiting.</br>
            You'll watch a bright dead</br>
            gas fall and take your place.</br>
            You will feel something</br> 
            electric and soon your</br>
            bones will change from</br>
            white to blue. What used</br> 
            to be your body will inflate</br>
            and glow. Nothing will be</br>
            able to touch you again.</br>
            Has anyone ever lived</br>
            through turning into concrete?</br>
            No, but it's intense. I will</br>
            look up at you and rent a</br> 
            light machine to send you</br> 
            a message: I know you are</br> 
            lonely right now</br>
            but I have ideas.</br>
            </br>
            <b>I Am Moving Into A New House &amp; Flipping All Of The Lightswitches On To Prove That I Am Capable Of Being Alive</b></br></br>
            but i do not feel alive &amp; it's taken me a few years to get here. the walkway is slippery with old tears &amp; the front porch hasn't stopped dripping blood for approximately eight days. who do i talk to about this? the government?</br></br>
            i did not ask to die this way. i'm wondering what kind of clothing my parents would bury me in. they would pick a dress even though i had asked multiple times to be cremated. mom PLEASE shoot my ashes into space. beyza, what kind of a daughter are you?</br></br>
            i don't want worms in my veins. paper cuts on eyes are something i will never stop crying over. feeling sand in between my toes reminds me of fucked up summers. i do not feel alive &amp; i don't want to be dead.</br></br>
            no one wants to live here. no one wants to make a home in the back of my throat. i want ghosts for neighbors, in theory.</br>
