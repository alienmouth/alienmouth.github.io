            <p>I know the hat and what it’s supposed to do. (Or maybe it’s a helmet.) I know what I want. I know why I got this thing. I know why I went through all of the trouble of going out and getting this thing. But now that I’ve got the thing in my hands it feels kind of silly. And honestly it kind of feels like it’s not going to work. From what I’ve read, all I have to do is put it on and it will do the rest. It’s as simple as that. I just don’t know why.</p>
            <p>Clunk. Isn’t it? It doesn’t make that sound but I like to think that it does. Because it’s now on top of my head, which is to say that I am on top of its head. Or something like that. In any case, this is what it looks like. All weird and bendy with new colors and things. Haven’t seen like this in a long time, so it’s all still kind of new to me, but here we are which is to say we. (And wee!) But the fun and the exhilaration are kind of empty right at the moment.</p>
            <p>Wow. That was weird. It was like I was just thinking the thoughts but they weren’t coming right out of my mind or something like that. I don’t know how to react. I guess I had read up in the manual or whatever that was going to happen, but I wasn’t really prepared for the full effect. It’s kind of unnerving. And I can already feel it coming back to the surface. Can’t afford to start-in on trying to use this thing until after it’s rolled through the foreground of my mind again. I hope I can hold on.</p>
            <p>Or maybe not. I’d really like to retain control indefinitely. I think that would be really nice. But I’m thinking with the tool now. I’m thinking with the mask. I really, really want to be rid of the rest of me. We all know what happens when the person takes the mask off, but what happens when the mask takes the person off? I’m actually kind of afraid to find out. Or maybe it’s something else. Maybe it’s excitement. Maybe I’m excited at the thought of taking the person off right now. I guess it kind of sounds like fun.</p>
            <p>But I don’t want to do that. I think I’m getting the hang of this thing. I knew what I was getting into when I put this thing on. Put this mask-like helmet thing on my head and I’m able to strip away those things that I feel are dangerous. All I need to do is focus on them and let my will eliminate those things about the world around me that I don’t want to exist anymore. I guess that’s going to involve visualization, but I’m going to have to time it perfectly or this thing takes over.</p>
            <p>Oh. Yes. That’s right. I can do that. I guess if the side of me that is the mask can play with reality then it doesn’t really matter whether or not there’s someone else attached to me. Like for instance, if I wanted everyone else in the world gone, they’d just be gone. I’m not saying that’s what I want so that’s not what’s going to happen, but that’s just some of what I could do if I wanted to. So if I can do whatever I want, what do I want to do? That’s a very, very good question.</p>
            <p>But I don’t want to do whatever I want. I mean...I do want to do whatever I want,  but I know that I can’t. (Isn’t that what separates us from the animals?) I’m not going to do whatever I want. There’s just this thing that I want to change about reality. One tiny, little thing and then I can take this damned thing off my head or face or whatever and get on with my life. I just can’t seem to remember what it was that I wanted to change right now because I’m kind of dizzy right now.</p>
            <p>Of course, I love being dizzy. It’s easier to follow momentum when you’re dizzy. You don’t have to worry about things like gravity when you’re dizzy. (Or maybe that’s just me.) I can do whatever I want to, but there’s a lot that I don’t want to do. I don’t want to get rid of everyone else. (That’s no fun.) I don’t want to get rid of all the vertical lines in the universe. (I happen to like vertical lines. I think they’re kind of cute.) But I can do whatever I want and there’s a delicious freedom in that.</p>
            <p>It feels like I’m taking control of this thing. The thing that’s on my head has settled down a little bit as I have this weird sort of dialogue with it. I want it to recognize that we’re both here and I want it to do something for me, but I can’t imagine what that might be at the moment. I guess it’s something that I can’t afford to think about too much otherwise the thing will know what I’m trying to do here. And then I remember exactly what it was and I try not to think about it.</p>
            <p>And it’s really just kind of boring. I guess I can kind of see where this is going. I can do whatever I want, but the knowledge that there aren’t any limits make the possession of limitless power and authority seem kind of . . .  boring. So this is how god feels, huh? Not terribly fun. And I know I’m playing into the strategy that I put into place when I put this thing on in the first place, but even though I want to live more than anything, the only thing that I can really think of to do at this stage is cease to be. It’s what I wanted. I wanted to destroy this thing and even though the me that is me wearing this thing really doesn’t want to, I know that I really have no other choice at this stage. I have to destroy what’s on my head. It’s why I tracked down this thing. The only one of its kind. To destroy it. Because no one should have something that can do this. No one. </p><p>
