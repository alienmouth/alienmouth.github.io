            the first bullet / i swallowed </br>
            / in / that sixth floor / hotel room /</br>
            a cock / tail / of bicep &amp; / bone </br>
            / went down / smooth / as mini bar / </br>
            vodka / did not ask / my name  </br>
            / only if he could take / off /</br>
            his raincoat / only / if he could  </br>
            / come / inside / (yes / yes) / </br>
            the second / you / precious pearl </br>
            / i cradled / in the back / pocket /</br>
            of my acid / wash / cutoffs </br>
            / made the world feel / less / </br>
            like a waiting / room / less </br>
            / like getting / your name / </br>
            called / but not / hearing / it </br>
            / O / seed / of ungrowth / you / </br>
            must be / a woman / the way</br>
            / you understand / empty / </br>
            how / you wreck / to protect </br>
            / your no / your not / now / </br>
            at the ultralounge / after </br>
            / sarah's abortion / she asked /</br> 
            what / you taste like / nothing </br>
            / futures / like the grass /</br>
            is greener / on every side </p>

            The barista at the shop with the most tolerable coffee </br>
             in town is like hi how are you? *wink* and I’m like idk</br>
             my sweater has a cupcake on it so good I guess  </br>
            and he’s like it also has a cherry on top *wink wink*  </br>
            Before turning on the grinder he says let me start her up  </br>
            do you want room for cream or should I fill it all the way?  </br>
            *WINKKK* and I really wish I jumped him </br>
            dark roasted his beans into a perfect shot of burn &amp; choke  </br>
            like can’t a girl order a small blonde blend in peace?  </br>
            In case you were wondering the word for heaps  </br>
            of headless women falling spread-legged from a man’s maw  </br>
            is women. The word for keeping the knees of my mouth together  </br>
            like a good little bitch is also women is also Maybelline Baby Lips  </br>
            Moisturizing Lip Balm is also soft, pink, your steak cooked  </br>
            how you like it, bikini line waxed with obedience.  </br>
            Look up the word cunnilingus on thesaurus dot com  </br>
            and you will find</br></br>

            <p><b>Today</b></br></br>
            i woke up &amp; the sky was like wooooow congratulations</br>
            here’s a cloud that sort of looks like it’s spelling out <i>snoop dogg.</i></br>
            today i dropped it like it was burning because it was. </br>
            today i watched a child wail at the grocery store</br>
            because he was too big to sit in the shopping cart</br>
            &amp; i was like i know right? today i used a knife</br>
            to slice the hunger it was intended for &amp; nothing else.</br>
            today my bills are past due. today i have a mailbox </br>
            for them to keep each other warm in. today you texted me </br>
            &amp; i turned into the emoji with hearts for eyes. </br>
            today my heart has eyes and they are open. </br>
            today i turned down a street that shares my father’s name </br>
            &amp; i’m sorry my heart had to see that. today </br>
            is his birthday but the candles are already blown out. </br>
            today i dumped salt into the bowl instead of sugar. </br>
            today the doctor made a list of options &amp; none</br>
            of them included time. today whiskey. today tequila, </br>
            kahlúa, the nips in the trunk from new year’s eve. </br>
            today greg got so drunk he ordered a bud light </br>
            at the wendy's drive-thru. today we pulled forward </br>
            to the next window. today i’m not sure </br>
            what the weather forecast will be but there is one </br>
            so it’s not all darkness. today [insert uplifting  quote</br> 
            by “unknown” here]. today the light turned yellow </br>
            &amp; i slowed down. today you said my name &amp; i heard you. </br>
