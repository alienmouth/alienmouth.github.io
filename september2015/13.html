            <p>“The next night we ate whale.</br>
            The next night we ate whale.”</br>
            -Tao Lin</p>
            <p align="center">i.</p>
            <p>A whale is inside of a whale.</br>&#09;Inside that whale is another whale.</br>&#09;Inside <i>that</i> whale? Me and Horace.</br>&#09;I call out to Horace, who’s currently trying to pry its jaw open. He’s one of these lughead types: all glamour muscle, clean-cut, neanderthal. His pride and joy is his willingness to resort to grunts and biceps.</br>&#09;“Dummy,” I say. “It’s a moot point. There are too many whales.”</br>&#09;He turns, gives up. “Bro,” he says. “Your pessimism might have helped you get a philosophy degree, but it won’t help here.”</br>&#09;“You’re wasting your strength,” I say, sitting cross-legged.</br>&#09;“Brosef,” Horace says. “We won’t get anything done if you keep sitting Indian-style and running your mouth.”</br>&#09;“It’s not Indian-style,” I say.</br>&#09;“We’re beyond politics,” Horace says. “Like we’re in a whale’s mouth, dude. There aren’t politics in here. And there sure as heck aren’t Indian people.”</br>&#09;“Three whales’ mouths.”</br>&#09;“Well,” he says. “That supports my point. We are far from Indian-folk.”</br>&#09;A rumble echoes up from the stomach. A burp? A fart? We lean in, listen.</br>&#09;Then, silence.</br>&#09;“False alarm,” Horace says.</br>&#09;I sigh and sit back down, not cross-legged.</br>&#09;“Anyway,” Horace says, and then stops talking.</br>&#09;“What? Anyway what?”</br>&#09;“I don’t know.”</br>&#09;“Ok.”</br>&#09;“Wanna play desert island?”</br>&#09;“No,” I say.</br>&#09;“Ok,” Horace says. “Let’s play Whale Mouth.”</br>&#09;“What the fuck is that?”</br>&#09;“It’s simple,” says Horace. “Name three things you’d bring into a whale’s mouth if you knew you’d have to be stuck there forever.” </br>&#09;“Three whales’ mouths,” I say. “And we won’t be here forever.”</br>&#09;“Is that optimism I hear?”</br>&#09;“Shut up.”</br>&#09;“I’ll go first,” Horace says. “Two thirty-five pound dumbbells, a six pack of Guinness, and a box of a dozen protein bars.”</br>&#09;“That was more than three things.”</br>&#09;“How?”</br>&#09;“Two dumbbells, six beers, and twelve protein bars? That’s like twenty things.”</br>&#09;“It <i>is</i> twenty things.”</br>&#09;“You said three.”</br>&#09;“Whatever,” Horace says, crossing his arms. “There is no math here, anyway.”</p><p>
