            The next night we ate whale.”</br>
            -Tao Lin</i></p>

            <p>A whale is inside of a whale.</br>Inside that whale is another whale.</br>Inside <i>that</i> whale? Me and Horace.</br>I call out to Horace, who’s currently trying to pry its jaw open. He’s one of these lughead types: all glamour muscle, clean-cut, neanderthal. His pride and joy is his willingness to resort to grunts and biceps.</br>“Dummy,” I say. “It’s a moot point. There are too many whales.”</br>He turns, gives up. “Bro,” he says. “Your pessimism might have helped you get a philosophy degree, but it won’t help here.”</br>“You’re wasting your strength,” I say, sitting cross-legged.</br>“Brosef,” Horace says. “We won’t get anything done if you keep sitting Indian-style and running your mouth.”</br>“It’s not Indian-style,” I say.</br>“We’re beyond politics,” Horace says. “Like we’re in a whale’s mouth, dude. There aren’t politics in here. And there sure as heck aren’t Indian people.”</br>“Three whales’ mouths.”</br>“Well,” he says. “That supports my point. We are far from Indian-folk.”</br>A rumble echoes up from the stomach. A burp? A fart? We lean in, listen.</br>Then, silence.</br>“False alarm,” Horace says.</br>I sigh and sit back down, not cross-legged.</br>“Anyway,” Horace says, and then stops talking.</br>“What? Anyway what?”</br>“I don’t know.”</br>“Ok.”</br>“Wanna play desert island?”</br>“No,” I say.</br>“Ok,” Horace says. “Let’s play Whale Mouth.”</br>“What the fuck is that?”</br>“It’s simple,” says Horace. “Name three things you’d bring into a whale’s mouth if you knew you’d have to be stuck there forever.” </br>“Three whales’ mouths,” I say. “And we won’t be here forever.”</br>“Is that optimism I hear?”</br>“Shut up.”</br>“I’ll go first,” Horace says. “Two thirty-five pound dumbbells, a six pack of Guinness, and a box of a dozen protein bars.”</br>“That was more than three things.”</br>“How?”</br>“Two dumbbells, six beers, and twelve protein bars? That’s like twenty things.”</br>“It <i>is</i> twenty things.”</br>“You said three.”</br>“Whatever,” Horace says, crossing his arms. “There is no math here, anyway.”</p><p>
