                Americans eat a lot of mouth cement.</br>
                I would like to get a job where I’m paid to stare at a thumbtack instead of a computer.</br>
                Should I create a new email account and then enroll that email account in community college so I can accrue more student loans?</br>
                When I was fifteen I ran away from home because if poems were fish then they would have long hair.</br>

                If the inside of your shoe becomes discolored caress it with egg whites and milk.</br>
