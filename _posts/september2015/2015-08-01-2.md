should I have given you my body<br>
when I was bleeding<br>
<br>
should I continue to give you my body<br>
over winter<br>
<br>
when Iâ€™m tender<br>
I almost love you<br>
<br>
we know because my body<br>
contains you<br>
<br>
feelings<br>
passed to me<br>
like steel balls<br>
meet bath pearls<br>
and gardenia steam<br>
<br>
I have acclimatised<br>
to these white hours<br>
<br>
abstracted<br>
my affections<br>
to the point of despair<br>
<br>
which layer is mine<br>
<br>
is it skin<br>
or warm water,<br>
foaming
