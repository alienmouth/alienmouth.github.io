I didn’t mean to be mean</br>
when I told Erika you probably don’t need sunglasses</br>
with a forehead like that</br>
I meant to be precise</br></br>

I am projecting because I think my eyes stink</br></br>

I mean sink</br>
more each day</br>
past my skull and inch toward my cerebrum</br></br>

soon my eyes will be fully submerged</br></br>

<p align="right">
      they will rotate 180</br>
      and I will see grey matter</br>
      dated and labeled</br>
      organized into</br>
      ascending</br>
      safes</br>
