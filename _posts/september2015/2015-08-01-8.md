Arizona's northern desert wears a patchy jacket of hand me down foliage cast off by thousands of years<br>
of silence <br>
Half baked mountains observe the asphalt arteries we are pumping thru<br>
Oi, we're on the run <br>
on the run from boredom <br>
&amp; boredom's burning coat of years<br>
trailing along the experiential embers <br>
that shine light from your belly <br>
illuminating the naked buried in your skin.<br>
There's a prickly pear beer top in my pocket <br>
&amp; thousands of miles carrying the silence of obsidian <br>
yet to scratch the record player mind.<br>
