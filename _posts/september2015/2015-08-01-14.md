The paws at the rump of my skull</br>
are too many.</br></br>
I’d be like a gold camel, who takes only sips</br>
at the water, and seldom.</br></br>

Here, there’s a birdhouse across the pulled water,</br>
behind the felled tree</br></br>
that dipped in a windstorm</br>
that howled like an eagle.</br>
Gold eagle.</br></br>

Napoleon sits, wears his laurels. He rots</br>
in Vermont, in a stoop or a hamlet.</br></br>
He’s mushed like the leaves</br>
resting under the birdhouse.</br></br>
The leaves resting under gold water.</br></br>

I say, “Would you screech, blind canary, or fluff</br>
like the gadflies I’ve seen all my life?</br></br>
I haven’t the lip or the pelt for it, no,</br>
I haven’t the hollow, prone, legible bones.”
