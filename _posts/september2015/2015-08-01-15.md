    Americans eat a lot of mouth cement.<br><br>
    I would like to get a job where I’m paid to stare at a thumbtack instead of a computer.<br><br>
    Should I create a new email account and then enroll that email account in community college so I can accrue more student loans?<br><br>
    When I was fifteen I ran away from home because if poems were fish then they would have long hair.<br><br>
