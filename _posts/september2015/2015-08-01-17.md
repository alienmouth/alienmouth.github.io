august looks like winter this year<br>
my drug dealer asked me on a date to go ice skating<br>
i google insomnia and delirium<br>
i look for another doorway in the bathtub n in my bed<br>
it doesn’t matter that we’re gonna die<br>
i feel like im dying often anyway<br>
what’s it like to breathe heavily<br>
across a snowy ocean<br>
