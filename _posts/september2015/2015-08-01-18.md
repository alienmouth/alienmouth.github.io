title: I want to be in love while playing the banjo. While playing the banjo, I will be in love. As I am in love and playing the banjo, I am also kissing you. All at once.

if you pump my stomach
itll just be pink gooey stuff
youll say to the doctor
whats all this? what is that?
the doctor will say
oh..my gosh!
it appears as if shes in love!
or, was in love
the gooey pink stuff clogged up her lungs
and she died
from being in love
we can revive her if we take it all out
you and the doctor take tiny shovels
and start scooping the goo out of my body
i cough a little and come back awake
hey guys!
im back!
the next thing you know,
youre inviting me to your house again
and i bring my ukulele
and by 11pm that night
during our soggy and cold sleepover
im being rushed to the hospital again
