if you pump my stomach<br>
itll just be pink gooey stuff<br>
youll say to the doctor<br>
whats all this? what is that?<br>
the doctor will say<br>
oh..my gosh!<br>
it appears as if shes in love!<br>
or, was in love<br>
the gooey pink stuff clogged up her lungs<br>
and she died<br>
from being in love<br>
we can revive her if we take it all out<br>
you and the doctor take tiny shovels<br>
and start scooping the goo out of my body<br>
i cough a little and come back awake<br>
hey guys!<br>
im back!<br>
the next thing you know,<br>
youre inviting me to your house again<br>
and i bring my ukulele<br>
and by 11pm that night<br>
during our soggy and cold sleepover<br>
im being rushed to the hospital again<br>
