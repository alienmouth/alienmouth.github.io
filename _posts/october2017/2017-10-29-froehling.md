*the animal shelter*

you have the skinny dog haggardness of it<br>
the gritty slicked slip of it<br>
on the rain’s long skirts, with your sewn on black shoes<br>
the choke chain tree of it has settled, embedded<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the hill’s neck, where you are, where it is<br><br>
somewhere there is an electrified pool outlet,<br>
a little winter weather’s jealousy next to a diver’s kit<br>
and you are sitting on the edge practicing bowing your head to your knees<br>
biting coins to give your breath some value once you finally gather the courage to drop everything you own and leave, you are<br>
practicing ducking from bullets whistling “you are my sunshine” in the breeze<br><br>
you understand this, i don’t, you do<br><br>
you’ve made plans:<br>
when the rust dissolves the bike lock, you are going to run<br>
because right now you have the floating, struggling openness of it<br>
the backyard manmade lake lyme disease of it, from<br>
where you are, where it is<br><br>
you  don’t know how alone you look, how tired you are<br>
barking in your sleep while everyone else howls abysmal holes to the sky<br>
reflected back into their faces,<br> 
they have the pockmarked fullness of it<br>
they are the full bird theatre of it, night feather shakes and earthquakes,<br>
glassy awake eyes in glass sockets<br>
necks perched on swivel chairs<br><br>
you are the warm placidity<br>
the sun rolling its muscles <br>
through the unstitching navy yard <br>
through the window and into my cereal bowl<br><br>
you understand this though, when i don’t<br><br>
i cannot replace you and if i could my honesty would fly<br> 
like a set spring of a dismantled pen or<br>
a gentleman’s hat freshly stolen by the wind<br>
or anticipation of a stranger’s thrown fist<br>
knocking on wood instead of the faux golden handle<br><br>
you are silent, you make your bed inside of a beehive on a muted TV<br>
it is always quiet where you are, where it is, when you’re wit<br><br>

*most kinds of cheese truly disgust me but you have the opposite effect*

i don’t need the moon<br>
as long as i have lights perched at intervals along the road<br>
like white and yellow birds who believe they have found special metal trees<br>
and are therefore too proud to leave<br><br>
i don’t need the moon<br>
as long as i have your distorted reflection looking at me<br>
through the cracks in a broken and recently-<br>
eager-esophagus-emptied-water glass<br><br>
i don’t need to be over anything to love you<br>
and i don’t have to make a fool of myself to prove it, like<br>
leaping around in a field of sleeping cows while wearing a fishbowl on my head <br>
pretending to be a lost astronaut to cope with it, <br><br>
or something to that effect<br>

*emetophobia*

what i mean to say, what i meant to say, <br>
i mean<br>
is that i’m happy you decided not to invite me<br>
to that party you hosted when everyone was home<br>
you’ve been saying life has never been so good lately<br>
so i imagine him looking at you like you are happy<br>
not the emotion, but a physical thing he can pick up<br>
and pocket and carry with him,<br> 
i mean, i don’t know<br>
maybe you are a nightlight or the last battery left<br>
in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the kitchen drawer, maybe you are the color yellow<br>
not like jaundice but sleepy sun stillness<br><br>
oh and speaking of illness i’m still mental<br>
because i think about vomiting at least twice a day<br>
and it makes me want to die<br>
i live with tomato soup in my throat <br>
and i can feel it boiling&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the back of my tongue<br>
when i sleep<br> 
when i lay on my side<br><br>
let me tell you, my mind cooks up the perfect grilled cheese<br>
to go with it<br>
so thank you, for not inviting me, it would’ve been embarrassing<br>
for everyone to see me cry and say the word regurgitation like a choke in my throat, thank you<br><br>
i woke up six times last night<br>
and the air kind of sounded like it was made of flies<br>
they tell me it’s blood in my ears but i know<br>
my plasma is mixed with crumbs and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the daily meal’s chunks<br><br>
anyway, it kind of reminded me<br>
of how he thought love was the way&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bugs crawl over fruit<br>
all tongues all touch<br>
how he thought maybe it was the way <br>
the wind filled up plastic bags and carried them for a little while down the road<br>
before sticking them to some slimier bit of pavement<br>
or maybe a flood prevention drainage vent<br><br>
i feel best when i’m not looked at<br>
i wish no one could see me<br>
i wish i didn’t have a body<br>
