Squint and it’s half-blue, bright <br>
blue, cobalt, atop half-green, grass <br>
green, bubbling up, gray <br>
orb in the middle.<br><br>
Tilt and it’s white light, yellow <br>
lightning, strikes kaleidoscoping <br>
in corners blue, gray, green.<br><br>
Open and it’s a brooke, a bike <br>
path, a hundred thousand trees<br>
piled on top of each other, reminding <br>
you life is just God dealing a deck of cards,<br>
blue and green dealing.<br>
