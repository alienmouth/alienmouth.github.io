there are subtle sweaters my mind knits you.<br><br>
they are *purple* when you walk<br>
*red* when you take your shoes off<br><br>
when i find printed socks i weave them in,<br>
and drip sweet old sesame oil between the hairs and the knit. <br><br>
there are subtle sweaters my teeth build you,<br> 
after i brush them too,<br>
when i don’t speak and it’s mostly in february<br><br>
what is it about the letters f ‘ruary’<br>
that squeezes in love<br>
through the cushions?
