Already in August the bees<br>
had gone to ground, <br>
burrowing for rain. <br>
Already we knew<br>
many things of winter,<br>
the frozen doorsteps,<br>
the slush on Third Street.<br><br>
The mower’s blade,<br>
unsharpened since my father’s death,<br>
startled two who rose and stung—<br>
the light of pain, the annoying<br>
thought that I was wrong—<br>
being there, a blaze<br>
of flesh, a man.<br><br>
We have our flannel<br>
and our heated rooms, <br>
hot water and the hour of sleep<br>
before we leap <br>
into the day, things to fracture<br>
and collect, things to heed.<br>
The bees are still, memorial,<br><br>
the winds of Illinois <br>
only they can hear. <br>
Already they knew<br>
in August the squalls of snow<br>
off Lake Erie, the dents<br>
men make <br>
as they perfect the land.<br>
