I.	city<br>
Where lives are controlled thru threats <br>
Drugs and violence. The audience<br>
hold crosses. Its ignorance  holds <br> 
Down the universe twisting  fingers. At night <br>
My arms hold multi colored crystals. My black <br>
Gloves like a symbol of God holds the addicts.<br>
My friend’s think I’m a painter. <br><br>

II.<br>
My name is Sunday. I survived <br>
Being a movie star. I felt  pain too much <br>
To be embarrassed. I’ve been the unemployed <br>
Friend. Quiet  dark and wrinkled. On  <br>
My stomach to soften my hunger. Good bye <br>
Not  the final word. If you believe that.<br><br>

III.<br>
And suddenly <br>
Breaking into sunrise. I came crying.<br>
I repeated all that happened. I was <br>
In back seat when the car pulled over.<br>
An explosive human stampede<br>
Happening on my ribs and head<br>
Police stripped me out two grams<br>
And dragged along the empty street<br>
My lips wet with blood, I thought,<br>
This my murder.<br><br>

IV<br>
Dying is an ancient disgrace like painting <br>
Poetry art literature. It’s dumb.  When I wake <br>
Up. Tell me you will  reach. Tell me you will <br>
Recognize. Tell me you will take<br>
 me to bed instead of your husband.<br><br>

V.<br>
The faint sound of sirens connects me<br>
To this place. It’s a  place that reminds  us <br>
Of Egypt. The children chew tobacco weed <br>
Leaves <br>
And marshmallows produce  a sap <br>
Used to heal wounds.  Everyone watching<br>
Everyone.<br>
