I see the crow split open<br />
when I should be watching the ocean,

a stain between frothing white lace<br />
and shell-bedded skin. I can’t stop thinking

about the utter wrongness of its body—<br />
talons curved inward yet still poised 

for slaughter, the red wanting<br />
where a beak should be, eyes and mouth lost

to another creature’s hunger. I wonder if it drowned,<br />
those tarred wings wilting first, or if its neck

had given way like ribbon. I’m not sure<br />
which one I prefer. Either way, 

there’s carnage. I think I’m in love <br />
right now and all I want is beaches 

full of dead birds. A flood of limbs <br />
washing up onshore. Seascapes sparkling

bright with bone.  I know this longing well—<br />
the same way a knife only knows

the yielding purr of softness<br />
as the world curls around it,

how a shark only knows<br />
bloodshed & swimming. This is 

how bad it is: I need <br />
someone else’s mouthful

of glossed teeth, or at least<br />
something sharp in my throat. I deserve

a proper maiming. I hope I never<br />
get used to the wound.
