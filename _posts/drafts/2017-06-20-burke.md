I suck my teeth at you<br>
and hear the clinking of keys<br><br>

a lemon in my mouth<br><br>

I used to be forgiven<br>
but now I am not<br><br>

an edge<br>
that rounded itself<br><br>

there are windows everywhere I go<br>
but I hardly ever count them<br><br>

I have never felt closer to god<br>
than when I smile at a TV show<br>
or maybe a child<br><br>

the best things<br>
are when it is quiet<br>
and I am alone<br><br>

I already know what your mouth tastes like:<br>
the forest floor<br><br>

in short,<br>
wet.
