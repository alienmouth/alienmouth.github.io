ride on my gnarly waves my dude<br>
exist in my oceans and I will show u how deep my waves can be<br>
dude<br>
man<br>
bro<br>
my waves will jive in u<br>
like the ocean<br>
always does<br><br>

spit on the lava of my volcanoes<br>
my friend<br>
if u spit on the lava of my volcanoes<br>
enough<br>
it'll do something really rad<br>
if u spit on the lava of my volcanoes<br>
it'll create islands<br>
with cultures and languages and shit<br>
and u'll look upon<br>
gaze upon<br>
lol<br>
look at the sickness of my islands<br>
our islands<br>
we did them together<br>
and u'll think<br>
"wow<br>
that is really fucked up actually"
