<b>Scattered Ashes</b>

Most of my life is a game of racquetball</br>
(I can’t like any of myself).</br></br>

This poem is a translation</br>
from the jar of tears I never cried </br>
after watching The Elephant Man </br>
and gasping, seeing that John Merrick’s left hand </br>
was the only part of his body that was not disfigured, </br>
and thinking that its calmness was spreading </br>
across his body </br>
to make him radiate beauty.</br></br>

I thought there was a poem to be found there, </br>
but something didn’t quite fit.</br></br>

I wanted to relate it to my own self </br>
but I could not locate my own unscathed left hand.</br></br>

My actual left hand bears a small white scar </br>
from where I accidentally lacerated the tissue </br>
when I was eight years old at my younger sister’s </br>
birthday party; I was trying to make a mask </br>
out of a weird kind of camouflage party hat</br>
(the world writes its own poems).</br></br>

I am more like a fish </br>
in a glass bowl </br>
that is rolling down the side of a mountain </br></br>

and the bowl shows my reflection </br>
and the bowl never breaks.</br></br>

You told me that all my attributes</br>
are more than just a fortress</br>
to surround something rotten</br></br>

but you are speaking to a wall</br></br>

and I am standing </br>
behind it.

<b>Motion Sickness</b></br>
<i>after Conor Oberst</i>

Life is not a room</br>
People don’t just enter</br>
through some door</br>
drop odd objects and disappear</br>
Everything including you</br>
is in constant motion</br>
The first time I died</br>
my failed red heart had to choose</br>
just one way to paint my body</br>
I could have been a ballerina</br>
spinning frantic, toppling over</br>
into stupor</br>
I could have been a trembling hand</br>
I became a peeling wall</br>
a black hole</br>
a beacon of loneliness</br>
became abstract fire</br>
to warn rooms of people</br>
avert, avert your eyes</br>
I radiate nothing, save for</br>
this pale beam of doubt</br>
please don’t watch my light</br>
that smacks the floor and shatters</br>
I am searching for a place to feel solid</br>
standing still before the thunderstorm</br>
this planet holding its breath</br>
getting dragged around the Sun</br>
