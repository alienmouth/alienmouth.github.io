the window is greasy and i can’t really see out of it. but i look anyway bc i don’t wanna look at you. a honeybee hauls itself into the lavender that’s planted in the flower bed. it flops into a grave and parties with the worms and bacteria. i want to party with the worms and bacteria. i breathe on the window. condensation builds. you drag your finger down it, gather the grease on your fingertip. you tell me to “suck.” i take your finger into my mouth. it tastes of your mother’s snoring habits.
