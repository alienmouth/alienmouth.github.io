It is easy to see the physical signs of someone gone:<br>
the hairs left on pillows, the fingerprint left on a glass<br>
left by the sink, the line etched into a wall where height<br>
was recorded until the recorded was never going to get<br>
any taller. It is not as easy

to see the smaller traces left behind: the indent in a pillow<br>
slowly regaining its shape, the glass left in the cupboard<br>
that won’t be drunk from again by the same lips, the lines<br>
on faces that won’t appear because they only come with age.<br>
 It is nearly impossible

to see the things taken away with the one who has gone: <br>
the color bled from hair with worry, the glass that is picked<br>
up and set down and picked up too many times because the hands<br>
just need to be doing something, the lines studied on the palms<br>
of hands because your fortune never told you that this is what<br>
would happen, that this is loss

and it is irrevocable. This evidence<br>
is the evidence that does not forget because you cannot forget.
