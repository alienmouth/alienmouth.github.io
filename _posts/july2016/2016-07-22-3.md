Coming home from electrolysis<br>
we think about the things<br>
we wish someone had told us<br>

Back when we still had time —<br>
like, “if you want to be<br>
a monster, you can just<br>

Slice open your skin and step <br>
out into the welcoming shadows<br>

In the woods by the side of the road<br>
— hunt birds, drink insect blood<br>

And grow scales, and faces<br>
to lure boys to their death<br>
when they drive by <br>

Leaning out the window<br>
screaming things<br>
