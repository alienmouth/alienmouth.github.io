the point, of course, is to road from the airport to the office,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to copyedit article drafts, to think of fresh content,
your boss, the lifestyle editor, by now, desked a cup of macchiato
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from that fancy rat-free coffee shop&#8321; you snob
no one escapes a hundred percent from capitalism, a workmate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who’s from that premier state university would say,
ironically, this once student activist is now fed by Chinese oligarchs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the company van driver can’t do anything about morning rush,
his supposed expertise, maybe he gives the passenger-employees smooth talk
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like your ex who recently graduated from his MFA,
but you’re a sucker for small chitchats: how dyou find the weather today?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plus your Tagalog has gotten worse since your last Filipino teacher
the thing is, you’re from the south, none of your alphabet blocks fit in, a clear outsider,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so you speak English all the time, now, you’re a burgis&#8322; in name,
but you still don’t stand out, you’re not from a UAAP&#8322; school

&#8322;Burgis is a Tagalized word for bourgeois.
&#8323;UAAP (abbreviation for University Athletic Association of the Philippines) is a collegiate athletic association
of eight universities located in Manila.
