the point, of course, is to road from the airport to the office,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to copyedit article drafts, to think of fresh content,<br>
your boss, the lifestyle editor, by now, desked a cup of macchiato<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from that fancy rat-free coffee shop&#8321; you snob<br>
no one escapes a hundred percent from capitalism, a workmate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who’s from that premier state university would say,<br>
ironically, this once student activist is now fed by Chinese oligarchs,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the company van driver can’t do anything about morning rush,<br>
his supposed expertise, maybe he gives the passenger-employees smooth talk<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like your ex who recently graduated from his MFA,<br>
but you’re a sucker for small chitchats: how dyou find the weather today?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plus your Tagalog has gotten worse since your last Filipino teacher<br>
the thing is, you’re from the south, none of your alphabet blocks fit in, a clear outsider,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so you speak English all the time, now, you’re a burgis&#8322; in name,<br>
but you still don’t stand out, you’re not from a UAAP&#8322; school<br>
