how long until the bad spot can be touched? I am asking for<br>
myself. here, there are so many bruises in the making. I stand<br>
up inside the orchardâ€”little seedlings gather, apple cores, my<br>
vertebrae stuck together, like so. is it ok if I crush you? I so<br>
want to, I so love this dripping all over.<br>
