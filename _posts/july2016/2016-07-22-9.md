<h2>Algona</h2>

the wedding is at the house<br>
I’d drive to after track practice,<br>
the house she grew up in,<br>
where we’d play Beetle Adventure Racing<br>

the first time I went<br>
to Sarah’s house, I’d never taken that left<br>
in front of the SuperMall before,<br>
I didn’t know there was a town there,<br>
that I imagine exists as a self-sustained world<br>
built just for you, with a Dairy Queen<br>
and library<br>

those summer nights we’d go to the park<br>
across the street from Robyn’s house<br>
and push each other on the tire swing<br>

and after things changed,<br>
I was still friends with your sister<br>
I would swoop her in my truck<br>
and I would see you standing<br>
and watching<br>



<h2>7-Eleven Part 2</h2>

I walked to the 7-Eleven<br>
on the intersection of M and 8th Street,<br>
the one we’d go to after Monday track practice,<br>
the one across the street from Teriyaki Wok,<br>
where we drank Slurpees in the bed of my truck<br>

7-Eleven is now a boulangerie<br>
with floor to ceiling windows on a boulevard,<br>
watching bakers as they enter,<br>
I’m drinking banana flavored coffee<br>

I see nouveau riche in front of over-flowing<br>
trash cans eating foie gras and burger dogs,<br>
and the parks down the street, called Scootie Brown<br>
and Indian Tom, changed their names<br>
to Jamison Square and Tanner Springs<br>



<h2>Secoma Lanes</h2>

I’m imagining taking the drive<br>
to Pullman tomorrow instead,<br>
through the Cascades and Columbia,<br>
and the corn flowers blooming,<br>
and the green glow of a car dashboard<br>
in a rural college town<br>

I used a hookah for the first time in Pullman<br>
at a place called Munchy’z. I was 18,<br>
in town for ‘Imagine Tomorrow’,<br>
an alternative energy science fair<br>

I watched 6 hours of Intervention today<br>
it made me feel things<br>
that I’m not sure how to identify—<br>
I don’t know if I felt an amalgam of feelings<br>
or if I felt something that people don’t feel<br>
often enough to have named yet<br>

I watched a video on youtube about<br>
humans ceasing to exist<br>
they said whole neighborhoods<br>
would be up in smoke as soon as lightning struck<br>



<h2>Seattle Aquarium</h2>

Oliver is visiting from Australia<br>
I meet him and Zac at Alleyway<br>
I ask Oliver what Perth is like<br>
because I’m thinking about Susanna,<br>
and wondering if she still lives in Perth,<br>
or if she moved back to her small city in Japan<br>

Oliver tells me about the difference<br>
between Melbourne and Sydney until<br>
I feel interested in Australia—<br>
not for a previous lack of interest,<br>
I just already think so much<br>
about so many places<br>

I mention a memory from senior prom:<br>
we went to Chase’s—a split level house,<br>
with meat rotting on the dining room table<br>
and yellow cigarette tar on the walls<br>

we smoked Backwoods inside,<br>
Chase was stoned and Kirk played<br>
Beach House over the speakers,<br>
and Chase said ‘this music scares me’<br>

Earlier that night, prom was at the Seattle Aquarium,<br>
and after eating too much fondue,<br>
I went to a concrete observation deck,<br>
looked up at downtown Seattle.<br>
the world seemed lonely and big<br>

I go to Zac’s to sleep on his couch<br>
because I missed the last bus home<br>

after prom, as the sun came up,<br>
everyone went to bed on Chase’s basement floor<br>
I drove my mom’s minivan home<br>
across Auburn, so she could use it that morning<br>

earlier on prom night, Isaiah stopped by Chase’s<br>
his tie was loosened and his collar undone<br>
‘I had the best sex of my life in the car’, he said<br>
I think he conceived his firstborn that night<br>



<h2>christmas lights</h2>

I want to watch Dragon Ball Z with you<br>
you’re in Washington with me<br>
but you’re in Seattle and I’m in Auburn<br>
you’re in a motel and I’m on Kirk’s back patio<br>
and I don’t know even if you like Dragon Ball Z<br>

spaces feel different when the spaces<br>
are related to other space in a new way<br>
like when I stopped by 7-Eleven<br>
on the way home from working<br>
at the carnival, I saw it as an island<br>
in darkness and I didn’t know<br>
Dairy Queen was across the street<br>

but then I learned that behind that Dairy Queen<br>
is what would become your house<br>
and that 7-Eleven became part of the fabric<br>
of something much bigger<br>

I imagine you went to a Chinese garden,<br>
I see you behind a tea house and pond<br>
you are standing perfect and perfectly still,<br>

I want to see you under<br>
the Christmas lights above my bed,<br>
that make your stomach skin look blue—<br>
every color of light is within those Christmas lights,<br>
so why does your skin only reflect blue?<br>



<h2>hot tub</h2>

I remember at one of Jack’s big house parties,<br>
not long before college,<br>
I crawled into the hot tub in my underwear<br>
four people joined me, including<br>
Dwight and Danielle—they were dating at the time<br>
we talked about the future and high school<br>

we climbed on to the trampoline<br>
and we laid flat on our backs<br>
in the young, breezy, summer,<br>
night air like a heated swimming pool<br>

Kirk played his guitar laying down<br>
we looked at space,<br>
and talked to each other without<br>
ever looking away from that canopy<br>
that looked like negative exposures<br>
of a stucco ceiling, and the whole time<br>
you kept chain smoking on the back porch<br>
