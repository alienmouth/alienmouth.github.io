<h1>Hansel, From Home: An Apology<br>
<i>(After Marie Howe’s Gretel From a Sudden Clearing)</i></h1>

There is no way to say it. Your window is collecting webs,<br>
your blackberries ripen and swell and fall

for the squirrels. Every day we spend less<br>
and less time waiting. Sometimes I stand on the roof

and say it into the wind: the first syllable<br>
rises and drops to the ground, and the second

gets lost in the forest between my mind and my mouth,<br>
to be picked apart by crows, who fly away

crying <i>rry, rry, rry.</i> I don’t know how I got here.<br>
How I made it here without you. All I did

was look back when you kept looking on,<br>
stumble through the dark in some

backwards way, kicking mushrooms, breadcrumbs,<br>
tripping over logs and nests, reaching

into your absence and finding suddenly<br>
a recognizable tree, and mother, out front, looking for stars.

I called for you, I swear. So did she.<br>
I try to say it in the morning, sitting on your bed:

but the first syllable gets caught in the webs<br>
of your open window, and when the spider comes

she wraps it up, pauses, whispers <i>so?</i>, and eats.<br>
Every day something of yours disappears.

The yellow dress, the small bird painting, and<br>
one by one the books. I move through our house

trying to say it. <i>I am so</i>, the clock has become<br>
bored by my eyes. <i>I am so</i>, I sleep terribly. <i>I am so</i>
