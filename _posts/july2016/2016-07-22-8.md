soggy field<br>
all bent <br>
and rain <br>
laden, you <br>
can see<br>
the paths <br>
animals took <br>
on their <br>
way somewhere,<br>
like wakes <br>
left softly <br>
by boats,<br>
their crews <br>
methodically working<br>
together to <br>
tie me <br>
up and <br>
embed me <br>
between flipped<br>
over hulls,<br>
roughly pouring<br>
jars of<br>
fresh honey<br> 
all over <br>
me, soaking<br>
me in<br>
honey if<br>
you want <br>
to be <br>
quite honest,<br>
draining fluid <br>
ounces down <br>
my throat <br>
until i <br>
can feel <br>
honey pressing <br>
against my <br>
lungs, until <br>
i can <br>
always taste <br>
honey in <br>
the back <br>
of my <br>
throat and<br> 
my pores <br>
leak, no<br>
stigmata, just<br>
slow rot<br>
and the <br>
princess spurns <br>
my amour<br>
and stoically<br> 
instructs that<br>
the punishment <br>
continue at <br>
all costs <br>
even if <br>
the captains<br> 
can no<br>
longer stomach <br>
the way <br>
husky flies <br>
have forgotten <br>
their old <br>
devonian rivalries <br>
and joined <br>
forces with <br>
wet shining<br>
beetles to <br>
really go<br>
down on<br>
me, alighting<br>
on virgin<br>
patches of<br>
skin to<br>
gnaw on<br>
and make <br>
burrows for <br>
wet payloads <br>
of their <br>
soft warm <br>
egg clutches <br>
deep in <br>
my melichrous <br>
skin and <br>
balmy organs <br>
looming just <br>
below my <br>
surfaces like <br>
rainbow trout <br>
flaring silently <br>
in the <br>
long pylons<br>  
of light<br>
that burn <br>
me, that <br>
slowly freckle <br>
my limbs<br>
as i <br>
moan and <br>
tauten in<br>
the old<br>
scrawny ropes <br>
binding me,<br>
supporting what<br>
my saturated  <br>
flesh becomes:<br>
something pestilential,<br>
something you'd <br>
catapult over<br>
the enemy's<br>
walls, and <br>
insects start<br>
to know <br>
my body<br>
more as <br>
a home <br>
than a<br>
higher power<br>
and they<br>
get front<br>
row tickets <br>
to watch <br>
my desperate <br>
personhood cede <br>
itself to<br>
something i<br>
don't know,<br>
an older <br>
style of <br>
living, more <br>
hubbub, a <br>
bustling commune<br>
whose nuances<br>
are hard <br>
to navigate <br>
at first,<br>
kinda like<br>
the cult <br>
i started <br>
during college<br>
i dedicated<br>
in honor <br>
of you<br>
and the<br>
soon-to<br>
