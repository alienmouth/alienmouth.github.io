<h2>SIMONE WEIL READ BY MASOCHIST</h2>

my way is to shrink<br>
in the presence of greatness<br>

a disappearing impulse that reacts <br>
in proportion to the degree of force<br>

this is how i come to god<br>

on my knees, hands bound<br>
behind my back, begging<br>

<i>please, fuck me, daddy</i>

<h2>GREGORY</h2>

sleeping in my mother’s apartment<br>
in my hometown i dreamt <br>
about my childhood<br>
rapist, who told me that it<br>
was a bourgeois notion to believe<br>
that all my friends should<br>
bring me comfort. i got<br>
red in the face and wanted<br>
to scream but didn't run<br>
or fight<br>

<h2>UNIVERSAL MONSTER</h2>

there are all these little forgettings<br>

like i can't remember <br>
what my nose looks like<br>
under all these bandages<br>

tracing the contours of this stitched<br>
up frankenstein’s monster line<br>
across my scalp<br>

the doctor says i’ve got <br>
a strong monster line <br>
lucky in love line <br>

now in my need for dramatics <br>
we’re covering all the mirrors<br>
and isn't this fun<br>

like we're vampires<br>
holed up in mexico<br>

like how fast does a mirror image fade<br>
when you turn away<br>

<h2>ORDINAL</h2>

i like the phrase devil’s <br>
threesome because it implies to me<br>
the existence of a spiritual ranking<br>
of threesomes<br>

i looked into a mirror that said<br>
meet the person most responsible<br>
for your safety <br>
and that felt like a lot<br>
of pressure<br>

ideally <br>
i would like to be standing <br>
between two large men <br>
with safe hands and<br>
the devil watching<br>
