there’s a dead bird dead<br>
on crystals with thorns<br>
like piss<br>
i’m going to cvs for<br>
heavy public toilets<br><br>

sad debris is my vampire<br>
under day sun<br>
let’s use the puppy dog<br>
filter as i perform breathing<br>
faces through bird beaks<br><br>

i say we need fat cheeseburgers<br>
you ignore my fat nails<br>
i apologize and settle for dead<br>
mouths i’m growing pains with you<br><br>

i’m eating dead seaweed and<br>
will save humanity<br><br>

let me spit hair and thread<br>
fake sperm in balloons<br>
blow now <br><br>

dead birds dying is a first<br>
world hypocrisy i have<br>
to pee in cvs<br><br>

i know my rights as dead<br>
cheeseburger my <br>
fingers are wet.<br><br>
