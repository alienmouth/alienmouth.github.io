There’s an egg in the dark<br>
and somebody talking to you.<br>
An egg in the dark and a man—<br>
you—under the shut sun.<br><br>

When somebody calls you all light up<br>
and walk the shores in rows<br>
like untrustworthy mushrooms.<br>
You are more scattered than a row<br><br>

and devour the flank<br>
after the battle. You take it down together<br>
and peel back the flank<br>
of the animal. Fur glued to paper.<br><br>

Paper glued to the backs of your hands.<br>
“It’s like it nourishes me.”<br>
You finally get to be sad like the moon,<br>
together. Everybody is mad at each other!<br><br>

You don’t know them! You<br>
know the sand. It’s thick,<br>
like silt. Your characters exit,<br>
presumably to have sex.<br><br>

You finally believe your luck<br>
sitting across from a great actress, who says,<br>
“Being with other people will ruin your life.<br>
Always should, always has to, always will.”<br>
