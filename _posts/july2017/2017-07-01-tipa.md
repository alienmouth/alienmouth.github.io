A thousand paper butterflies shed –<br>
skin, hair locked onto shoulders bare<br>
in cabins cornered you see, They see<br>
darkest of dreams, brightest of nightmares, They<br>
tromp and stumble like unordered stringencies –<br>
nameless, faceless wings and things<br><br>

playing games on damask and toile, toiling with untethered<br>
tassels and troughs, wretched bobbins and thimbles <br>
misplaced and mislead<br>
molasses mouse traps and maidens drowned –<br>
and ants feast on dead ends of Her<br>
and blood on sodden handkerchiefs<br><br>

William, your harpy’s here<br>
and heaven is far away
