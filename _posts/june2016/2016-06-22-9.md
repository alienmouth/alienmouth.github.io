i.<br>
:: foliage<br>
summer is long gone<br>
winter is yet to come<br>
let alone the spring but<br>
let me come to think of it;<br>
about the brown fall for<br>
it can be a perfect lesson<br>
about how death, of leaves<br>
and living things, at the very<br>
least, is beautiful and<br>
ephemeral and beautiful and<br>
ephemeral and be—<br>
<br>
ii.<br>
:: apollo<br>
exploding tanks, wasted oxygen,<br>
choked throats, dry lungs, almost lost<br>
forever in foreign space and home;<br>
but home was the last thing we recalled<br>
because the suits that allowed us to walk<br>
inside this zero gravity cubicle<br>
needed to call a small station in that<br>
rotting blue planet, first of all<br>
we were almost forever lost<br>
yet home was calling us home<br>
<br>
iii.<br>
:: postman<br>
he gazes through the window<br>
and mumbles about loneliness;<br>
of himself, stamp and airmail,<br>
an old office he will someday leave<br>
for retirement but then he checks his<br>
phone and giggles and stops mumbling<br>

look at the girl in sweater<br>
and brunette milk braids<br>
crying while knotting the<br>
dead dots beyond the skies<br>
we can hear you, little girl<br>
don’t hope for silly things like<br>
getting new band merch for<br>
christmas or losing weight<br>
to the constellations because<br>
even when we have lived here<br>
for million years, we are still<br>
unseen, our hopes are crashing<br>
and burned like one of those dead<br>
dots, again, but we are also one of<br>
the dead dots, again, just in the<br>
other side of galaxy you don’t see<br>
<br>
v.<br>
:: feast<br>
my name is toothpick<br>
but nobody picks me before<br>
dinner or in the middle of dinner<br>
or after dinner; whenever<br>
