I bought pepper spray yesterday cause it was $10<br>
& bedazzled. It’s still in the box on the kitchen<br>
table. When I met Adam I was wearing a<br>
halo cause it was Halloween. I gave it to him cause<br>
he was turning 22 at midnight and also<br>
probably I fell in love or maybe out of the sky<br>
or both. We had so many sleepovers. We ordered<br>
so much Chinese food. We were so sad about<br>
money. Kelsey was followed home twice &amp;<br>
that was when I liked her so I was really empathetic.<br>
She has a knife with a cat on it even though<br>
she’s more of a dog person.  I have bedazzled<br>
pepper spray recommended by Cosmo<br>
in a plastic box on my kitchen table even though<br>
I’m more of a person who’s scared all the time.<br>
