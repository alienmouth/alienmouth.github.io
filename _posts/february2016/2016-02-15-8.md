<p>You know my favorite thing about the skyline?<br><br>

The Verizon® logo.<br>
It ruins the view so much that it’s kind of beautiful in its own way.<br><br>

It’s real.<br><br>

and<br><br>

I guess time just doesn’t stop for us dear,<br><br>

They made the summer faster to skip the previews,<br><br>

We keep cutting corners though,<br><br>

like wild frost flowers growing out of their habits.<br><br>

You know what?<br><br>

This would probably look better on my screensaver,<br><br>

Bird baths, Cherry Blossoms,<br><br>

Yellow taxi cabs.<br>
A lonely peanut<br>
inside a yellow flavored M&amp;M.<br><br>

A chocolate smudge on our shirts.<br><br>

You got my heart leaking 16 fl oz. at a time.</p>
