<p>I eat<br>
lemon sorbet<br>
until the roof<br>
of my mouth<br>
cracks and bleeds<br>
with tartness.<br><br>

A yearning<br>
to feel,<br>
even <br>
if it&#39;s just<br>
&quot;too cold,&quot;<br><br>

is it innate<br>
in me, or<br>
was I destined<br>
to be warped<br>
into this slow<br>
collection<br>
of dust<br>
floating<br>
in the<br>
ocean?</p>
