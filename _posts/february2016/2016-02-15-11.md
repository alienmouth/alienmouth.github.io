<p><b>Application of Oz</b></p>
<p>Do you identify more with the witch<br>
or with melting? The puddle or the<br>
screaming? Are you the doe-eyed girl,<br>
slippers tapping together, or the color red<br>
and are you loving it? Are you the first or<br>
last time she says home? Who could <br>
play the part of the yellow brick road?<br>
Are you the journey or the lion? Are you<br>
tin or straw and are you gay for the other?</p><br><br>
<p><b>to sara june woods</b></p>
<p>happy birthday<br>
birthday girl<br><br>

in my sea witch<br>
there's a woman so tall<br>
her head pokes out above the sky<br>
all she sees up there is fire <br><br>

her spine holds a river though<br>
i sail in it<br>
the tides tattoo her shoulders<br><br>

she doesn't lie down to sleep<br>
so we don't get crushed<br>
just closes her eyes<br><br>

in her honor, so do we</p><br><br>
<p><b>Meeting</b></p>
<p>Who are you from?<br>
Where is your name?<br><br>

I fall asleep to John talking<br>
about the French Defense<br>
every night in a blue room.<br><br>

What are you?<br><br>

Trains carry me places<br>
in cars of mounting luggage.<br>
I sit naked on<br>
leather seats my round body.<br>
My genitals are a tiny <br>
animal balloon.<br><br>

Why are you doing?<br><br>

Do you want to come over &amp;<br>
make noise together? Talk music?<br><br>

When were you sad?<br>
How did you do it?</p>
