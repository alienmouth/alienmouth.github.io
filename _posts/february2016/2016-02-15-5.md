<p><b>who&#39;s to tell</b><br><br>
<p>don&#39;t concern yourself w/ why i fall<br>
silent in the dime store dressing room<br><br>

i&#39;m simply considering what the cops<br>
could tell about me from my corpse alone:<br><br>

twenty-something / female / nailbiter<br>
a ham in the bedroom (groomed pubic hair)<br><br>

poor circulation / chronic disease / purple knees<br>
eats amitriptyline, cyclobenzaprine, daily b.c.<br><br>

forever not ready for... next of kin? forget it<br>
just a long procession of indiscretions<br><br>

one after another, who&#39;s to tell whether<br>
she fell in love too easily or not at all?<br><br>

subliminal scars traverse wrists, shins<br>
chief inspector thinks stigmata, then chokes<br><br>

back his unchewed dogmatism, spewing out<br>
baptismal-like onto the parking lot, rinsing away<br><br>

all forensic evidence of foul play or wtf<br>
i was last seen trying to say, <i>choke me</i><br><br>

only long enough to make the ceiling blur<br>
to make the mad forget their self-inflicted<br><br>

sores, deep inside the drawstring pockets<br>
of the body left to rot outside your door</p><br><br>

<p><b>fucked up firsts</b><br><br>

out of my whole palaceful of taxidermied teenage boys<br>
you’re my favorite, pissing eternally on the rubber moon<br>
perhaps we never rly landed on the perfect NASA snap-<br>
shot of the kennedy assassin i&#39;m down here wearing as a hat<br>
as if it&#39;s just another tourist trap inside my dirty film debut<br>
there&#39;s no one actually inside me but a b&amp;w tequila worm<br>
they green-screen the erection in later, pin the tail on the <br>
imaginary friend, play <i>pretend we were each other’s fucked<br>
up firsts</i>, redeeming the worst virgin daze of our lives<br>
thinking sex on the beach wouldn&#39;t hammer sand straight<br>
through my hourglass physique- yes, i see this year <br>
it&#39;s chic to misremember, tremor, have too much to drink<br>
but in the long run who will recreate, cosplay the deadbeat <br>
dungeon master w/ his feet up on the back of daddy&#39;s seat?</p><br><br>

<p><b>alphabentitus</b><br><br>
psycho junkyard varmints got me magically bat-shit bankrupt by meat-juice o&#39;clock<br>
like fuck there&#39;s nothing left but our asbestos back porch & fat guest room cigars <br>
on &amp; on &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oh no she didn&#39;t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; roll credits for jesus &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rape a rainbow in its sleep<br>
I&#39;m verifying my own virginity w/ a magnifying glass until the sun starts to burn through<br>
I been thank-you-much baptized in ape shit & jungle funk since the day I was first misconstrued<br>
I still feel it running out the raging parties of my undies: reefer dens &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mushroom hells &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lazy <br>
underage keg stand&#39;s embarrassing back bend of death &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; why don&#39;t we maypole this day trip <br>
into pagan outer space? like some unstudied workweek rerun of my favorite sci-fi show on blow<br>
I&#39;m not changing my street name this late in the game &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not taking any rides downtown<br>
just to powder my ashes over the village oil can &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or snub the upchuck cuties on the corner<br>
for asking why my robot buttons glow no longer &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; short answer: my ALPHABENTITUS<br>
JUST DON&#39;T GO THERE tear my clumsy stunt double &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a new uptick esophagus <br>
suck the noxious tusk melt from my slutty mirror skirt &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at mid-dock I should have said it  <br>
sure as my former den mother is now an orthodontist &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sure as shit is getting out of hand</p>
