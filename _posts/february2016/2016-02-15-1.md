<p>He is shamelessly happy<br>
to take out the trash.<br>
He descends the spiral staircase<br>
and follows the stone path<br>
laid out to the can. <br>
Well, no longer a can-<br>
more like giant Tupperware<br>
with wheels. Late October,<br>
winter on the way.<br><br>

He has a smoke in the alley.<br>
The neighborhood is dying-<br>
everyone is moving closer<br>
to downtown, closer <br>
to the ache of the city.<br>
He doesn&#39;t mind-<br>
popularity is unusable.<br><br>

This row of Victorians<br>
used to be elegant, similar<br>
to the photograph of an actress<br>
long dead, or almost there.<br>
Only a matter of time before<br>
the block is bought up<br>
and leveled for something<br>
monstrous and profitable.<br><br>

We must be brave when everything<br>
is taken away. He exhales<br>
and looks up to where<br>
the moon should be, but is not.<br>
His beard is more white<br>
than gray, his eyes<br>
more closed than open.</p>
