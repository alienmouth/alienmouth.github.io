<p><b>Wigilia Dinners</b></p>
<p>A muddy patch on Greyhound windows,<br>
scraping clean in claret bath lacquer<br>
mulling heat rash ruddy amongst<br>
the stomach pain swirls inky acidic<br>
markers as testament to what gets<br>
left as unburned kindle, as untested steel,<br>
as chalkboard theory, as textbook framework.<br><br>

Embrace of asphalt arms, the model<br>
sparkling monuments to welfare states past<br>
which guide as gilded wire to weary dawns<br>
forward in militia march of white faced<br>
hours, leaking pavement shades in buckets<br>
for trenchant timing up is the strongest<br>
suit of cardstock to have handed.<br><br>

Plastic cups, plates of precious silver,<br>
like a mismatch of Wigilia and milk bar,<br>
wash against each as sandshore rocks<br>
the barring remove of aparting ocean;<br>
as still as life mural painting, stand<br>
up personable, but it&#39;s not the<br>
sort of supper you have until you&#39;re<br><br>

older, able to make sense.</p></br></br>
<p><b>Ode to DLR</b></p>
<p>You and I should meet on air,</br>
in these whirling hyperloop palaces</br>
of all burnished steel, treated glass,</br>
Polish plumbers&#39; expressions of effort</br>
possessed of a breaking cold becoming</br>
strangely humble,</br></br>

as if you could meet anyone,</br>
from anywhere,</br>
when next break light chimes.</br></br>

You and I should make an affair,</br>
bathe in serendipitous twinkle of</br>
Alexandra Palace hill light,</br>
click heels and wish to tune</br>
of Turkish butchers&#39; instrumental clatter,</br>
seeming soundtrack of Haringey</br></br>

as if there could be anything,</br>
all desires,</br>
in off-beat pulse of gig space walls,</br></br>

in the grandeur spiral of 8 million</br>
we sometimes find ourselves.</br></br>

as two points alighting the same.</p>
