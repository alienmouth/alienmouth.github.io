<p><b>the elder scrolls</b><br><br><br>
the part in oblivion<br><br>
where you go into the painting<br><br>
and you have to fight the painted trolls<br><br>
but you don&#39;t have enough turpentine arrows to defeat them<br><br>
so you run up a hill<br><br>
and try to cast fireballs at them<br><br>
but their health regenerates too quickly<br><br>
because the leveling up system is broken<br><br>
and bethesda realized this and fixed it in skyrim<br><br>
but you aren&#39;t playing skyrim<br><br>
and now the trolls have murdered you<br><br>
that&#39;s what it feels like not talking to you</p><br><br><br>
<p><b>cheat code</b><br><br><br>
not feeling very motivated<br><br>
not feeling very challenged by life<br><br>
because i live in my childhood bedroom<br><br>
this is life on easy mode<br><br>
you can&#39;t get the best ending on easy mode<br><br>
i don&#39;t care about endings or beginnings or the middle<br><br>
mature people take coffee breaks at starbucks near their places of work while talking to other working people about work<br><br>
they write short non emotional emails that refer to the contents of spreadsheets or other emails<br><br>
they do this for forty to fifty years<br><br>
i stare at a screen and wait for the internet to tell me what emotion to experience next<br><br>
there is a gigantic hole in my mind that information technology plugs up<br><br>
i try to imagine myself feeling worked up enough about life to scream silently in my head for three hours but i don&#39;t<br><br>
i would flush this poem down the toilet but it’s on my macbook and that won&#39;t fit down the toilet even if i shatter it first<br><br>
so instead i just stare at it and try to subtract any emotion­inducing lines or words out of it because aren&#39;t we past that stuff by now<br><br>
imagine seagulls flying toward the sunset growing and expanding into Salvador Dali type creatures dripping liquid clocks over parked cars and pedestrians while humming chopin&#39;s nocturnes<br><br>
would that be beautiful?<br><br>
i don&#39;t know what is beautiful<br><br>
this poem is an exegesis on continental philosophy and aesthetics<br><br>
beautiful things disappear as you approach them<br><br>
my computer is telling me not to get a job<br><br>
i tell it ok<br><br>
i feel better for a little while and then don&#39;t</p>
