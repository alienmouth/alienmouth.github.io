<p>in the house behind me a gun was fired<br>
and everyone mistook it for a firework-<br><br>

for a vessel, reckless and ephemeral <br>
pyrotechnics and bodies...<br>
one and the same, i guess.<br><br>

the point is he died,<br>
while I looked at the Internet<br>
and masturbated in my bed.<br><br>

many deaths have occurred<br>
while i&#39;ve masturbated in my bed.<br><br>

this reality and the eeriness<br>
of the Starbucks mermaid,<br><br>

are more grounding than a funeral.</p>
