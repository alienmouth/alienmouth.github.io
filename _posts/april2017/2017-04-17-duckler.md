<h2>some of the river</h2>

She looks into the flat silver river surface, millennia ago,<br>
to see if she is beautiful. Forgive the outmoded feminine<br><br>
attribution, the suggestion of hypersexualized vanity<br>
the tired notion of female vacuity <br><br>
but also fuck off, voice in my head,<br>
polluting the surface of her flat silver memory <br><br>
looking in the glass<br>
to confirm she is beautiful<br><br>
that everything that touches us leaves a mark<br>
even the moving hand over moving water<br><br>
even my mind with its judgements<br>
a bird that flies over and over without landing<br><br><br>

<h2>An Anthology</h2>

I could not wash the sweater vest I used to scream at him<br><br>
for lying on, since it is all that remains of the dog.<br>
I tried to toss it in with the non-delicate but stopped<br><br>
when I brought it up to my nose and breathed again  <br>
his tangy urine, fragrant air from an innocent tail still in motion.<br><br>
What memory will shake me if I clean it? My only memo <br>
came from the masterful poet who said if we write<br><br>
about our dead dog he’ll ban us from the anthology. <br>
I would have screamed at him but I let his wife do it, <br><br>
as he listened humbly in a scrubbed sweater vest,<br>
to the high pitch of her voice, in the stink of the past <br><br>
and who can blame him? Not the dog. Not me.<br>
