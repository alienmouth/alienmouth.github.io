<p>Dear Virginia,<br>
I see you everywhere, <br>
in the stars, in the river,<br><br>

to me you’re everything that exists; <br>
the reality of everything.<br><br>

I wish I knew how to write for art <br>
rather than self-expression. <br><br>

I’d like to go on for a few lines<br><br>

without weaving in <br>
the way you make me feel <br><br>

somewhere<br><br>
                       
here<br><br>
