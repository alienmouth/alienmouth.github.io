<b>Fuck Molly</b><br><br>

If I wanted to be happy for two hours<br>
and depressed for two days<br>
I could've just stayed sober<br>
and saved myself<br>
$20.<br><br><br>

<b>Untitled 1</b><br><br>
Sheryl Crow keeps coming to me in dreams asking why the hell I'm so sad,<br>
and when I wake up my friends ask me the same question in more subtle ways<br>
like, "why haven't I seen you in awhile?"<br><br><br>

<b>Untitled 2</b><br><br>
I'm gonna write a movie called Twitter<br>
that has nothing to do with Twitter<br>
except that there are 140 characters<br>
and they are all desperately seeking validation.
