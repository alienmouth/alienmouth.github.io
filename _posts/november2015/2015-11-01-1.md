Body wants to give, but give <br>
for want. Lays the arms out <br><br>
like oars. Nothing else <br>
smells like the ocean save for your hair <br><br>
after salt has tied into. Fingers <br>
of the Navy Yard Basin make a pass <br><br>
at the BQE. By East Mill, Body <br>
pulls a tooth from its mother, <br><br>
her mouth the rigid shore. Says <br>
when none of us were happy <br><br>
we went to the creeks, separate <br>
like corners. We are arrows <br><br>
in the same animal. Infidelity<br>
has always tempted us.<br><br>
Weâ€™ll both sleep alone tonight. I wore <br>
this lipstick for myself.<br><br>
Somewhere, we are spectators at a wedding <br>
The dance floor is an armory<br><br>
If I am a blood-red lip<br>
you are a mouth of bad cornmeal.
