<p style="text-align: justify; width: 350px;">yesterday i spent so long on the toilet that the sensory light switched off n all i could see was the colour black_<br>
<br>
like that night we rode our bikes down the road between the thicket n it was like we could have kept riding n riding for the longest time n not have been anywhere, like what happens after you die</p>

<p style="padding-left: 275px; text-align: justify; width: 350px;">n it was so black i might of heard the wheels turn on the gravel, or your shallow cycling breaths, or the air conditioning, or a dripping tap, bare bottomed and the toilet bowl, or denim and a bike seat, or a duvet, or a womb, or Lisa</p>
