<p>Something floats along my eye, its gone now<br />
Something floats along the Eagle Nebula<br />
This object&rsquo;s light diffuses across the memory of a long night<br />
It can be seen reflected in the waxed linoleum floors of<br />
The (now closed) Pathmark off North Broad Street<br />
<br />
Turn off the florescent lights, then imagine&nbsp;<br />
Gliding across the Pillars of Creation in a<br />
Chrome shopping cart<br />
<br />
Back on earth, dust will fill the shadows of my hands<br />
As the two form prayers<br />
Underneath a clinic&rsquo;s unassuming drop ceiling<br />
<br />
Riding the bus, thinking about rough knuckles,<br />
Hairy pits, and morning breath<br />
Rereading messages, occasionally<br />
Looking out the windows/imagining the self<br />
Something unrealized but fulfilling<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;No answer, except acceptance&rdquo; &ndash; they say to me as I walk out<br />
<br />
Any minor gloom will turn the slim comfort of this<br />
Distracting peasouper into a bed without pillows<br />
So memorize the expression&nbsp;I make before saying &ldquo;maybe&rdquo; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; As sand shoots up into the mesosphere, becomes glass,<br />
And rains back down&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Capture the smell of this world ending in fire and remain cautious<br />
Of shiny, yet sharp, things that only mirror the worst angles</p>
