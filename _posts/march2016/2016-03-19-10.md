<p>The way you stack this music<br />
voice atop voice<br />
you lean to<br />
inhale how rhythms breathe<br />
and cause the body&rsquo;s bounce to<br />
accumulate effort. Nothing<br />
sleeps here: light births itself<br />
&mdash;light is a misery that folds<br />
hours into absence. You run,<br />
the music follows, voice and<br />
further voice misleading the<br />
body: if you close your eyes<br />
to imagine a moment of<br />
prayer, rest, this day<br />
will become light creasing<br />
your purpose, setting the<br />
skin aflame.</p>
