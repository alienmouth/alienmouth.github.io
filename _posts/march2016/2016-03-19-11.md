Picture me doing somersaults<br>
across your abdomen<br>
<br>
and drawing houses made out of q tips<br>
directly on your frontal lobe<br>
<br>
I did really well in AP biology<br>
I just wanted you to know<br>
<br>
that when I picture your insides<br>
I am viewing them anatomically<br>
correct<br>
<br>
I have a tendency to exaggerate<br>
or at least thats what<br>
my mom has told me<br>
<br>
she taught me how to fold fitted sheets<br>
and how to alter my voice<br>
when making professional phone calls<br>
but that part she did indirectly<br>
<br>
I am a good listener<br>
I promise<br>
<br>
I know that there are ways to feel good<br>
<br>
I never learned how to do a cartwheel
