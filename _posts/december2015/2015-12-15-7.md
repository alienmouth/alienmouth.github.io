I would like to build a movie of your life that lasted a lifetime. And this life follows another.  And that life follows this. Therefore a lifetime would be forever. I am ready to make this movie. I am ready to watch this movie. And now I will. And so I will go. I am ready. I think you will be happy. It’s time for us to enjoy the rest of our lives. For the movie to begin.  Just look at the curtains, how wonderful they are, how they open like birds at a window, dying to be outside.

<p><b>I Declare</b><br><br>

If you say I love you enough, it sounds just like a rock skipping on a frozen lake, which you would think would sound really sharp and hard, but it actually sounds just like mallard ducks looking for little fish under the ice of a frozen lake.

“I love you,” the mallard ducks say to the little fish, frozen in the lake.
