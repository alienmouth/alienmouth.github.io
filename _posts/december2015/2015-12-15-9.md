As I stood on the deck of a ferry, wind against my face, slicing<br>
through dark waters under blue sky, I thought about things on the<br>
borderlands of possible and impossible, like digitally-manipulated<br>
art. You seemed to be all around me: in the giggles of children, in<br>
the conversation of lovers, in the cries of hungry seagulls, as they<br>
conducted aerial maneuvers for alms.

I thought about beginnings and endings, and yesterdays and nows and<br>
tomorrows, and I could feel you there, a presence just beyond the<br>
periphery. Everything shouted, but only I could hear your name in the<br>
thick throats, in the sea hiss, in the engine rumble. I heard you<br>
somewhere over the Olympic mountain range, past the mountain goats<br>
past the snowcaps; you were where the sun lays down to die, and I<br>
thought of you dreaming by its side, content, full of love and loved<br>
in full.

Later, in the ferry terminal, I read fictional constructs from another<br>
time, from another place, and there was a certain heat in their<br>
fictional lives that felt familiar, that felt reflective of us,<br>
without actually being us.

I tried to explain to myself what 'was,' but still could not explain<br>
what 'is.' It was some foreign word on the tongue without translation;<br>
a novel not yet fully conceived; it was a song yet to be heard by<br>
ears, and it was the sonic boom that filled the skies with your<br>
pounding heart, as metal spires loomed into view on the horizon,<br>
growing larger and larger with your bright welcomes, until the sight<br>
was more than any one man could take.
