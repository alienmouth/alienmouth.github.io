<p><b>Everyone Wanted a Bicycle</b><br><br>
<p>The gelatinous boulder, blue-skinned, grows beyond the blades of the playground.<br>
Homeowners continue their calls. They press fingers into screens a bit more forcefully.</p><br><br>
<p><b>Bus Ride Somewhere</b><br><br>
<p>An ear bud turns into a miner inside my ear.<br>
He is drinking water from a canteen, talking to someone on a cell.<br>
I can feel his head getting sweaty. His voice is raspy.<br><br>
The interior loosens and something gold appears.<br>
The gold shakes like an agitated tigerÂ <br>
and the miner swings his axe, cracking the gold in two.<br><br>
He eats both pieces; the chewing echoes<br>
until the lonesome feast concludes. Then he immolates.<br>
He slams his fiery hands into the floor of my ear<br>
and screams; I cannot look anywhere.<br><br>
Jerking violently, he becomes a miniature sun<br>
and flows freely through my body as if I were a ghost.<br><br>
And sitting wherever he wants in me, sensing my weaknesses, he projects<br>
from his ten thousand flaming mouths an afternoon<br>
in which I am completely stupid and what-the-fuck about everything.</p>
