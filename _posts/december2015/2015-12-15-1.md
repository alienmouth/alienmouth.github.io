<p><b>Untitled 1</b><br><br>
Chicago is weird<br>
outside the library<br>
a man offers me<br>
coffee nuts<br>
I am polite<br>
so I say no<br><br>
tonight<br>
went on a date<br>
with a guy who<br>
looks like James Franco<br>
we bring up the B word<br>
binge<br>
let’s go<br><br>
a different<br>
date tells me<br>
he found the<br>
slasher films<br>
I was in in college<br>
I panic<br>
he smiles<br><br>
here, a story:<br>
a little girl’s arm<br>
bruised fingerprints<br>
from the principal<br>
in a closet<br>
I am alone<br>
it is cold<br><br>
it is cold<br>
in Chicago<br>
but Boston has more<br>
snow<br>
my older sister sends me<br>
pictures of our home<br>
she says it is an<br>
igloo<br>
I want to be in an igloo<br>
for my future honeymoon<br><br>
this summer I want to kayak<br>
grew up with a canoe<br>
in my backyard<br>
only ever canoed New Hampshire<br>
when visiting<br>
Uncle Eddie<br>
who wasn’t an uncle<br>
just<br>
my dad’s friend<br><br>
snow turns me into a child<br>
on Michigan Avenue I am<br>
crying<br><br>
I am so happy<br>
you are having<br>
a good week<br>
now tell me what you ate<br>
list it so I know</p><br><br>

wade<br>
slip<br>
the river<br>
mostly long<br>
summer clouds<br>
crawled<br>
we caught crabs<br>
in buckets<br>
the color red<br>
full<br>
under rocks<br>
go<br>
the bridge<br>
the ocean<br>
little river<br>
swim back<br>
little bodies<br> 
up<br>
down<br>
limp<br>
see our arms flop<br>
no bones<br>
built like<br><br> 
see the large rock<br>
hide in high<br>
tide<br>
the marsh<br>
grows<br>
green<br>
the river<br>
has<br> 
hair<br><br>
look!<br>
the sky <br>
is there<br><br>
and now<br>
there</p></br></br></br>
