i remember anne<br>
mostly as a voice<br>
on the phone or <br>
a body curled over<br>
the kitchen counter<br>
crying at the end<br>
of something i was<br>
too young to understand

it turns out she died<br>
4 years ago<br>
somewhere in nevada

i didnít even know <br>
she'd moved

poets and outlaws as <br>
sparkling fuses between<br>
the beating of wings<br>
and the blinking of<br>
buzzards in a desert<br>
no oneís bothered to name

and later, pieces of harold<br>
lloydís hand in the<br>
prop bucket

and youíll never have to work again.

eddie finds a few <br>
factoids and lorca's <br>
left eye on the<br>
clearance rack in<br>
the curiosity shop<br>
of the human heart<br>
they pay for themselves

and he walks out into<br>
the world w/ a new found<br>
faith in the christian work <br>
ethic and lorca's left <br>
eye in his back pocket

the squealing of tires<br>
and monday morning hung-over<br>
moaning of would be<br>
olympians manages to<br>
keep the birds away<br>
in a city where all<br>
the signs read<br>
fuck you        pay me
