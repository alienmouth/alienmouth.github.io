Having a cat, used to talking<br>
to myself, there is a limit<br>
on how much catastrophe<br>
we can handle. 34 left<br>
at the nursing home to die<br>
fell on the bad side.<br>
Since when are we satisfied<br>
with a slow gouge without<br>
resolution and revelation<br>
of the emotion at play?<br>
There was a time when she<br>
cranked up the category, as if<br>
to say, Hey this is what a body<br>
looks like turned inside out!<br>
(I am talking to myself again)<br>
I reconcile that slush-thrower<br>
peeling back the city’s onion-<br>
strata with no space for grave-<br>
yards to stack bodies in layers.<br>
I’ve made sandwiches before,<br>
all the while talking to my cat,<br>
waiting for its backtalk.
