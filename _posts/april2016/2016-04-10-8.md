<div class="line-bigger">
	I say <i>aspen</i> meaning <i>elm</i> and <br>
	speak of the cottonwood. <br>
	The boy was not in love with <br>
	trains as the other boys were, <br>
	and ran from their distant <br>
	noise in terror, ran until a <br>
	parent scooped him up and <br>
	hugged him near. <i>Harmless</i><br>
	<i>time</i>, she whispers. Red is not, <br>
	however, obviously endless. I <br>
	watched three men grill three <br>
	rows of sausages each on <br>
	three grills facing the beach.<br> 
	That was the morning after <br>
	the earthquake article, and <br>
	we all felt somewhat older. <br>
	Uncommon seeing. A habit <br>
	imbues what is hope with <br>
	actual practice.
