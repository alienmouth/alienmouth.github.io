**Equinox**

A deranged tourist plans to slash any paintings in a gold frame. It’s easy to do. The vulture lifts him to the other side of the abyss. And so the God of our fathers tumbles out of the sky. Given how much is going on, more than a few friends botch their latest suicide attempts. I pull the cushions off the couch, the books off the shelves, try to pull up the floorboards with my bare hands. Tomorrow, if not today, spring will follow, a small, wildly twitching snake between its legs.

**Security Questions**

What was your childhood nickname? What was the last name of your third grade teacher? What is the first name of the boy or girl that you first kissed? Almost anyone – a shoelace vendor, clerical staff, Peruvian neo-Maoists – can guess the answers. It’s easier than you think. The fact is, they know why you keep stopping what you’re doing to stare with various degrees of consternation at your phone. Better for all if you turn up the collar of your coat, hide your face behind dark glasses, and walk faster, a lot faster, like Sartre when he thought he was being followed down the street by lobsters.
