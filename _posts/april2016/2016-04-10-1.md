I almost miss the cacophony  <br>
of Brash Crashing syllables <br>
that New England <br>
way of sounding <br>
off on the street  

that porch on Manchester <br>
Street, that apartment <br>
with carbon dioxide sneaking in <br>
with the heat, <br>
filling rooms in a drowsy fog  

the street lights buzzing clementines <br>
above the neighbor who has fallen <br>
drunkenly in the street <br>
and a band <br>
of angry rescuers<br>
Yell and drag at him  

in the confusion   half a dream, I was resigned to  <br>
the mess of it all <br>
A dash of freckled sun <br>
that was you in the winter  

By spring the sky unfolded<br>  
and I was gone
