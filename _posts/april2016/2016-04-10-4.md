Let us take all the long time we need<br>
To wake up from our overdue dreams<br>
Get out of the bed, and stretch our<br>
Limbs as far as possible for a new morning

Let us take all the long time we need<br>
To listen to the first song of the birds<br>
Watch the rise of this summer sun, feel<br>
The breeze combing each tree with tenderness

Let us take all the long time we need<br>
To enjoy being together with our beloved<br>
Exchange a smile so that they can stay with<br>
Us just a few seconds or even minutes longer

Yes, letâ€™s take all the long time we need<br>
To drink this tea, to chat about this weather<br>
To look back at the road we have travelled along<br>
To think, to cry, and to die in lingering twilight
