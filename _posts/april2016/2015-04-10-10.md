I tried on a dress <br>
at Zara.

I took a selfie of my<br>
spaciousness

inside<br>
Of It.

I didn’t buy it.<br>
Even though I wanted to.

Even though I <br>
had the Power to.

but I wanted to<br>
Buy It.





Rage, rage<br>
against your<br>
inner capitalism.

Rage, rage <br>
deep in the fist<br>
of your Softness.





Spotify is trying to get me<br>
to listen to my ex’s music.

And I’m all like<br>
‘Only 

if the songs are all about <br>
how amazing I am’.

But really I’m just like ‘nah’.<br>

I don’t listen.<br>
even though I want to.

Even though I<br>
have the power to.

But I do want to<br>
Hear.





I feel Real<br>
waiting for the metro

with other real people.

How do you do it?<br>
I think at them.

How are you so good<br>
at being a human?

In the Loft<br>
people are doing stuff.

Casually asking for money<br>
without having done anything.

I feel real<br>
but imaginary as well<br>
somehow.

I feel shy about<br>
reciprocating this Feeling

I haven’t let out<br>
Yet.
