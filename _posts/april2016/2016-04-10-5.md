i love you more than that train car <br>
& the things you made me feel in it <br>
made me feel like the train car<br>
(stained by clay/spring heat)<br>
(filled with abandoned wasps’<br>
nests you filled with cigarette<br>
breath til it dripped out like <br>
spit down your pretty mouth)<br>
(like some day a couple o’<br>
kids might just fall in love <br>
within my red rotting wood,<br>
their hands not touching but<br>
held somehow–i remember<br>
something in a science class<br>
about how we’re all always<br>
touching if you think about<br>
the body as a magnet & <br>
since i’ve met you i’ve been<br>
thinking about my body as<br>
one of those little wooden<br>
train cars with the magnets <br>
on either end & you as a <br>
train car with a magnet on <br>
both ends & my heart’s a <br>
little kid with hands that <br>
keep pushing us together <br>
somewhere behind or <br>
beyond the tracks, beyond<br>
the smoke)
