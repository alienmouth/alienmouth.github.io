<p>inspired as you sleep</br>
i can’t contain this </br>
heart next to yours</br></br>

your music matches my outfit</br>
and we go together </br>
like a pair of socks i’m missing </br></br>

you are what i wanted </br>
and what i’ll regret giving up</br></br>

spent too much time </br>
memorized in movements </br></br>

like pulling the door </br>
open at the bank</br></br>

taking out money to spend</br>
on each other instead of </br>
our futures we see in one self</br></br> 

and maybe it sounds cheesy</br>
or maybe they’ll get jealous </br>

by the many times each day</br>
you push contents thru me</p>
