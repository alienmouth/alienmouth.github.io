<p>We are in a locomotive television.</br>
Our head is heavy of the phosphors. </br>
Glitch spills on our tongue.</br>
Vases are going off the rails, blue cells, sick berries.</br>
Endlessly in speed, our hands off the wheel. </br>
Rotten, hulled in our own battling skin, </br>
discordantly beaten throughout our membrane.</br>
Insane, swiped under stumps.</br>
Blackened spew forked our third eye blind.</br>
Hooked to the screw of pills murmuring us to keep calm.</br>
Dying inside trying, can't walk in the open</br>
because it is already too late.</br>
Shredded to worn, almost choking in the swarming </br>
dead gore germs from our own mouths.</br>
Our house has become a wolf hole.</br>
Feasting on cold bodies blue, </br>
eating the faces off of the unmindful.</br>
Our feet in the gruel of grey maggots, black cadavers</br>
and soft sad tissues. </br>
We are tricked, taken for a ride whenever </br>
we are to transpire tiredness from this horrid immoral reality.</br>
Nutmeg scattered on our nerves. </br>
We are too close to the television, our hair roots are dull. Tangles sea coral through our head.</br>
Witnessing our own self into the suction to not turn it off.</br>
We are in a locomotive television.</p>
