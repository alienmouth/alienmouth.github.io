“What’s the most fun you can have</br>
with bending light?” he wants to know</br>

as we sit on the banks of the Rainy River</br>
watching sunbeams break into rainbows.</br>

I shrug, throw some bread out onto the water</br>
and we watch small fish leap and thrash.</br>

Suddenly his face is filled with light,</br>
his hair ablaze with honey-gold.</br>

Then, shadows of clouds and a quick cold</br>
ripple of wind. His hands burn red,</br>

and as the waves shorten all through</br>
the spectrum, orange, green and all the rest,</br> 

until they pulse ultraviolet, as he turns</br> 
to shield my face from x- and gamma rays.</br> 

When clouds pass, air warms around us as</br> 
sunshine glides softly over the long river’s</br> 

curl. He smiles, his face starlit, his shining</br> 
hands soaked, transformed by mystery and joy.</br>
