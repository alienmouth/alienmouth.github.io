<p>Growing up, from swing set<br>
to cigarettes, my street had no swimming<br>
pool, only bent circles<br>
with no net, metal hoops<br>
nothing<br>
to catch inflated or pass,<br>
except blunts packed<br>
from older brothers<br>
who rode a different bus<br>
and all wore the same color.<br><br>

Haircuts were tell your mom<br>
if she has time for me<br>
after dinner.<br>
Not ask, because what’s grammar.<br>
What manners? We’re neighbors.<br>
Our fathers carpool.<br>

On Fridays after work they drink<br>
together, sink bottles <br>
under<br>
steel-toed boots<br>
away from trashcans and wives<br>
and throw attention at neither<br>
except when there are messes<br>
to clean up.<br><br>

What’s missing is replaced<br>
by what is there. <br><br>

A living beat, rhythmic and organic our poetry<br>
is freestyle cyphers, flow calisthenics<br>
and eight-oh-eight olympics.<br><br>

How else would you explain six streets<br>
and one stop? I guess that’s why<br>
we don’t<br><br>

say no to a lung party</p><br>
