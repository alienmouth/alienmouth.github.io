<p><b>Something</b></p>
<p>I’d die to walk into a bathroom, do my thing, wash my hands and look up, see: EMPLOYEES MUST WASH HANDS BUT EVERYONE ELSE? YOU DO YOU, which is kind of like saying IT IS WHAT IT IS, which is a kind of LET IT BE.</br>
</br>
DON’T WORRY; BE HAPPY</br>
</br>
It’s like that part in the bible when god thought it was all just good.</p></br>
