            <p>we accept submissions in .txt, .doc, .docx, and .pages files for written work. for visual art please use .png or .jpg in the highest quality. our print edition is in black and white, so if you’re submitting visual art to the quarterly please keep that in mind. for music submissions please send a link to a soundcloud or a bandcamp account, not the file. if we accept your music submission, we will contact you for the file.</p>
            <p>email alienmouthbooks@gmail.com with your work attached. include which version (the monthly online or the quarterly print) of alien mouth you are submitting to. keep in mind that the month the quarterly is published there will be no online version, only selected pieces from the quarterly.</p>
            <p>some other publishers we really like are “the newer york,” “have u seen my whale,” “civil coping mechanisms,”“bear parade,” and “boost house” so read those to catch a feel for what we are going for</p>
