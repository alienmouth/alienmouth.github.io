          <div><p><strong>Housekeeping</strong><br />
<br />
Throw your baseball cap<br />
in the dishwasher.   (This<br />
could be your son.)   Use <br />
diminutive language.   Clean<br />
the kitchen, try to get<br />
high.   Remember:   you are fascinated<br />
by repetition.   (you are<br />
a human being.<br />
              A letter comes<br />
to “DAD” from Richmond.   For fear<br />
of Federales, do not open.   It’s probably<br />
an acronym.   Instead, buy expensive<br />
underpants.   Knit a knit suitcase<br />
reinforced with discarded three-<br />
ring binders.   Swallow everything.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Explication</strong><br />
<br />
I am behind you <br />
in the stairwell<br />
explaining my <br />
absence, that I had<br />
purchased a book<br />
and would accept <br />
two more.   I appreciate <br />
value.   I will buy<br />
two toothpaste tubes <br />
for the price of one-<br />
and-a-half.   I am <br />
a happy American.<br />
I am fit enough <br />
to enjoy a little<br />
snacking.   I have <br />
a girlfriend.   I have<br />
a twelve-speed bike.<br />
My girlfriend<br />
is a twelve-speed bike.<br />
I was androgynous as a ten-<br />
year-old; I had long,<br />
beautiful eyelashes <br />
and red red lips.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Dear,</strong><br />
<br />
all of these salted<br />
crackers represent<br />
love.   jangling keys<br />
stand for consumerism<br />
and self concept:<br />
catalytic, you leave me<br />
without nexus— excited<br />
particles conform to skin<br />
of a balloon giraffe,<br />
an emptied mayonnaise jar<br />
<br />
the physical aspect of matter<br />
is a kind of honorific assigned<br />
to colliding energies— particles<br />
of space connecting space<br />
so when my sleeves give way to elbows<br />
whatever’s really going on<br />
has as much to do with being still<br />
as a swinging lamp,<br />
bleeding lotus flowers<br />
and rose-red wine.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>[How to un-do things:]</strong><br />
<br />
How to un-do things:<br />
Cut directly through<br />
the center—peel the subject’s<br />
skin, fit to something more<br />
deserving.   We are<br />
all divine, perfect images<br />
of a vengeful schizoid—<br />
There is nothing more<br />
frustrating than waiting<br />
in line at the Post Office,<br />
and little halves of books<br />
are kind and unassuming.<br />
The best customer <br />
is a repeat customer.<br />
For these many years<br />
rain’s been falling sulfur<br />
dioxide and various mono<br />
nitrogen-oxide hammers.<br />
I billow through the troposphere<br />
collecting notes for maps.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>My Body</strong><br />
<br />
Parts of me are falling off<br />
and acting like they know what’s going on.<br />
An expression of my recessive genes<br />
has appointments in two different cities,<br />
each accessible by greyhound.<br />
My nose inchworms across the carpet,<br />
encouraging comprehensive empathy<br />
for other selves I’ve met.   Not that I need<br />
reminders, really, it’s just there are<br />
so many parts. My nasopharynx wants<br />
to eat Korean noodles—the rest<br />
disagree.   I’m glad you seem to understand;<br />
I want someone who seems<br />
     to understand.<br /></p>

Yell and drag at him  <br />

A dash of freckled sun <br />

To enjoy being together with our beloved<br />
Exchange a smile so that they can stay with<br />
Us just a few seconds or even minutes longer</p>

To drink this tea, to chat about this weather<br />
To look back at the road we have travelled along<br />
To think, to cry, and to die in lingering twilight</p>

to myself, there is a limit<br />

at the nursing home to die<br />

Since when are we satisfied<br />
with a slow gouge without<br />
resolution and revelation<br />

There was a time when she<br />
cranked up the category, as if<br />
to say, Hey this is what a body<br />
looks like turned inside out!<br />
