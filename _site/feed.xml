        <description>&lt;p&gt;it always seems like honking makes the city &lt;br /&gt;
bigger than usual &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;on most days. you told me you wanted me&lt;br /&gt;
to tell you when the reign of seafood was over, but&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;first, witness agave leaves ablaze, &lt;br /&gt;
wads of green &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;spikes browning deeply to&lt;br /&gt;
curly wafts gathered near &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;your face, like smoke unmade&lt;br /&gt;
from a once and future king’s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;spice filled censer served a la mode &lt;br /&gt;
from a roadside stand, sturdy walls &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;glazed in ozone&lt;br /&gt;
and pocked with abalone bits, proprietors &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sworn to grill soft shell shrimp, tiny &lt;br /&gt;
appendages, pincering mandibles, all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;consumed by the infuscate water disappeared&lt;br /&gt;
down the sinkhole growing &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;inside. your soft neck blows about me &lt;br /&gt;
(do you remember what i was talking  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;about about like ten lines ago?&lt;br /&gt;
oh, your face and smoke? again? ok, thanks). i tile wood &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;floors with coins rather than tiles, so really &lt;br /&gt;
it’s more like harboring a villain &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;than anything else, or perhaps like burying&lt;br /&gt; 
ligamental chunks of you &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for to grow in the blood &lt;br /&gt;
red clay and bewitched moss&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;my house rests on.&lt;br /&gt;
all in all,  i think it’s just got to be&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;your touched destiny &lt;br /&gt;
and me, and then some &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;out of the loop obelisk guts&lt;br /&gt;
we CTRL + S’d for eternity &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in talking cookie jars&lt;br /&gt;
shaped like thieving bears&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;whom get their stinking paws off on&lt;br /&gt;
my collection of unfulfilled promise &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;rings melted down and recast &lt;br /&gt;
imperfectly into planet shaped musket balls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you’re told&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to sit still until birds call out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;your name &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in the rain &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;made gloom,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;informing you &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;your table is ready.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you’re told &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;when you visit the sea&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the waves are saying something&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;that sounds &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;suspiciously like&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“we miss you” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;over &lt;br /&gt;
and &lt;br /&gt;
over &lt;br /&gt;
and &lt;br /&gt;
over &lt;br /&gt;
and &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;even though i don’t know &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you, yet,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i think this&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;gestures across the two of us&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
could be as true as all that&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;gestures above the two of us&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Marine Biology</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If we were entirely made by thread, I’d be the red yarn. &lt;br /&gt;
There is something about rods and cones &lt;br /&gt;
that doesn’t seem to like danger. They work like facets on diamonds, &lt;br /&gt;
sample lipstick at the grocery, white letters on stop signs; &lt;br /&gt;
like the word “caramel” when I say it. &lt;br /&gt;
God, I just want to be important. I just want to be someone real. &lt;br /&gt;
The early autumn leaves have me thinking deep crimson hue is only okay &lt;br /&gt;
when it’s fifty miles early and I should’ve expected it. People don’t like that color: &lt;br /&gt;
it’s like being hit in the face with a shit-ton of bricks, and nobody wants &lt;br /&gt;
to be met with something real. &lt;br /&gt;
What’s the fun in being real when you have to prove it? Let’s see, &lt;br /&gt;
I have a dog. When I was four I stepped on a nail and had it taken out with tweezers; &lt;br /&gt;
when I was seventeen I glued cigarettes into scrapbooks. When I was old enough &lt;br /&gt;
to call bullshit on Andy Warhol, I made a choker out of tabs off Campbell’s chicken noodle soup and a severed G string from my guitar. Sometimes,&lt;br /&gt;
I sit in bed and wonder how to shed eyelashes &lt;br /&gt;
and the effects of antidepressants on women taking birth control. &lt;br /&gt;
World history probably warned me about this: &lt;br /&gt;
being a bitch is like manhandling a group project, &lt;br /&gt;
everyone drowns you in praise ‘til you fuck up. I’m waiting for you to smoke it off.&lt;br /&gt;
I’m waiting for you to stare at the sea ‘til you’re positive there’s something there.&lt;br /&gt;
Under all these deeply damaged layers of artificial material and cheaply-crafted plastic,&lt;br /&gt;
there’s something there, and I can’t believe it’d take a bachelor’s degree to see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Some Spirits Have Been around Longer Than Other Spirits</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The universe is doing well. There are many planets. There are many planets we cannot see. Planets with names like MOA-2007-BLG-192Lb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Milky Way galaxy there are 100 to 400 billion planets. If you want to name a planet you can. Name it anything you want. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A person on Earth looks at a computer screen. The person is Larry Page. Larry Page has named two planets. Larry Page is looking at his computer screen thinking about eternity, non-existence, prostate cancer. Larry Page is going to die. In his next life, he hopes to be a Solitary Eagle, Harpyhaliaetus solitarius. He will live in South America, soar above the Peruvian rain forest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, a person in a two-bedroom house watches a movie and laughs. Another person hides under a blanket and reads. Between the visible stars are more stars. Between Larry Page and the tree is twenty feet. Between Larry Page’s mind and the world is his skin.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Fear, O Shakespeare</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A thousand paper butterflies shed –&lt;br /&gt;
skin, hair locked onto shoulders bare&lt;br /&gt;
in cabins cornered you see, They see&lt;br /&gt;
darkest of dreams, brightest of nightmares, They&lt;br /&gt;
tromp and stumble like unordered stringencies –&lt;br /&gt;
nameless, faceless wings and things&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;playing games on damask and toile, toiling with untethered&lt;br /&gt;
tassels and troughs, wretched bobbins and thimbles &lt;br /&gt;
misplaced and mislead&lt;br /&gt;
molasses mouse traps and maidens drowned –&lt;br /&gt;
and ants feast on dead ends of Her&lt;br /&gt;
and blood on sodden handkerchiefs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;William, your harpy’s here&lt;br /&gt;
and heaven is far away&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>cvs</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;there’s a dead bird dead&lt;br /&gt;
on crystals with thorns&lt;br /&gt;
like piss&lt;br /&gt;
i’m going to cvs for&lt;br /&gt;
heavy public toilets&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sad debris is my vampire&lt;br /&gt;
under day sun&lt;br /&gt;
let’s use the puppy dog&lt;br /&gt;
filter as i perform breathing&lt;br /&gt;
faces through bird beaks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i say we need fat cheeseburgers&lt;br /&gt;
you ignore my fat nails&lt;br /&gt;
i apologize and settle for dead&lt;br /&gt;
mouths i’m growing pains with you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i’m eating dead seaweed and&lt;br /&gt;
will save humanity&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;let me spit hair and thread&lt;br /&gt;
fake sperm in balloons&lt;br /&gt;
blow now &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;dead birds dying is a first&lt;br /&gt;
world hypocrisy i have&lt;br /&gt;
to pee in cvs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i know my rights as dead&lt;br /&gt;
cheeseburger my &lt;br /&gt;
fingers are wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;—- &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Parade Is Not Diplomacy</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s an egg in the dark&lt;br /&gt;
and somebody talking to you.&lt;br /&gt;
An egg in the dark and a man—&lt;br /&gt;
you—under the shut sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When somebody calls you all light up&lt;br /&gt;
and walk the shores in rows&lt;br /&gt;
like untrustworthy mushrooms.&lt;br /&gt;
You are more scattered than a row&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and devour the flank&lt;br /&gt;
after the battle. You take it down together&lt;br /&gt;
and peel back the flank&lt;br /&gt;
of the animal. Fur glued to paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paper glued to the backs of your hands.&lt;br /&gt;
“It’s like it nourishes me.”&lt;br /&gt;
You finally get to be sad like the moon,&lt;br /&gt;
together. Everybody is mad at each other!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t know them! You&lt;br /&gt;
know the sand. It’s thick,&lt;br /&gt;
like silt. Your characters exit,&lt;br /&gt;
presumably to have sex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You finally believe your luck&lt;br /&gt;
sitting across from a great actress, who says,&lt;br /&gt;
“Being with other people will ruin your life.&lt;br /&gt;
Always should, always has to, always will.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Peut être</title>
        <description>My boy wears grease that &lt;br&gt;
smells like cinnamon in his hair.&lt;br&gt;
It lingers on the pillows &lt;br&gt;
and I don’t want to forget that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

There aren’t any squash in the garden but&lt;br&gt;
the blooms sure look pretty&lt;br&gt;
like springtime tender&lt;br&gt;
even in the eleventh month.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

When there is rose &lt;br&gt;
lemonade at the market&lt;br&gt;
and when there are curbsides &lt;br&gt;
bathed in sunlight, &lt;br&gt;
maybe.&lt;br&gt;

        <title>Highly Sensitive People</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am seated at a dinner table, surrounded by old friends. My posture is upright and leaning forward. Everyone is laughing. John says he has an aversion to birds, but he likes toucans because they have commercial appeal. John’s cultural high mark is always commercial appeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My palms are clammy. I excuse myself and go to the bathroom. The window is open and I look out at the big wilting oak in the backyard. Its leaves shake and tremble. There is a big smeared sky. The sun goes down over the horizon, pixelated and snuffed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m really gawking, having a hard time accepting it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bathroom has an aquatic theme, seashells on all surfaces. There is a skin-pink conch, a bowl of shimmering abalone, a jar of sea foam air freshener. I turn on the hot water. It runs over my hands. 
Back in the dining room, John’s wife, Asmanti, who goes by Aasra, says, “I like the shiny fruit, the glossy ones.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John seizes the moment: “Commercial appeal.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ask if they want to play a board game. They say they would. I put three boxes on the kitchen table and ask them to pick. John, Paige, and I agree on Monopoly, but Aasra says she doesn’t have all night. We chat. Aasra seems detached and spacey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think my dad has Alzheimer’s,” she says. “He loses things. His keys, his wallet. It’s not the losing but the searching.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Doesn’t seem too extra bad, honey,” John says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aasra turns to him. Frustrated, she says, “You think death is for old people.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John looks confused, like a boy being punished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all agree we’re tired and say our goodbyes. I’m standing alone with Paige. The driveway is enormous and the street is quiet in the way autumn is quiet. Mounds of brown and rotten leaves populate the lawn, softening the rattle of the highway. I ask if she needs a ride home. It’s a dumb question considering we’re in the suburbs and how would she have gotten here. She says she drove, but that I could bodyguard her to her car. She says it like that, with bodyguard being a verb. “A piggyback?” I say, turning my shoulder down and crouching. It’s funnier as a thought in my head, in a perfect scenario. She punches my arm. It’s hard enough that I feel a sting. “What do you think about John,” she says, like he’s changed or something. “I don’t know,” I say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She thinks he’s confident in a way that worries her. She says I’m overly quiet—I could use some of whatever John has. I do an impression, “Commercial appeal.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Toucans,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At her car we hug. I can’t tell if she’s hugging me tighter than usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s early morning and the freeway is empty. I let the car drift, take up space. I chant the names of lawyers on billboards—Ahaab, Guntner, Niedecker—godlike and stern. On the radio, DJ Plato experiments with noises that rail and reverse, birthed from motherboards. The car’s tires peel against asphalt, producing a long endless rip. The dimples, the potholes, the quiet of the repaved sections. The high pitch of the thin, parallel grooves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m at home watching PBS with Anna. We’ve been together for six years. The program is about the Roosevelt family and their patrician ambitions. I think about my life and all my average ambitions, my girlfriend’s average ambitions, my friends’ average ambitions, the overall ease of it. Anna is at the other end of the couch. She stares at me until I look back at her. I focus on the TV. She says the Roosevelts cared so much; they cared so much about everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anna and I exist in a world that doesn’t resemble what we’d expected. Initially we went at our relationship in a focused way. There was a side-by-side feeling. In time we sputtered, made tiny adjustments in degree that grew to unsaid distances. Now it’s lonely and painful and neither of us knows what to do to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Maybe the Roosevelts don’t count,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theodore Roosevelt’s wife and mother died on the same day. His wife died in childbirth and his mother from typhoid fever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That day,” says Ken Burns, “Roosevelt wrote in his journal a single sentence that revealed more about his inner life than any other entry: ‘Today, the light has gone out of my life.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I drive to San Ramon where I know of an In-N-Out. I call Paige but she doesn’t answer. At In-N-Out I get animal fries. My phone rings. I let it ring without answering. I call her back and it goes to voicemail, so I say something about a movie that I want to see and that she might also want to see. “Communicate through voicemail,” I think. “It’s not cheating if we don’t speak directly.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I drive past my exit. I can’t go home yet. Eventually there’s the Best Buy, the Michaels, the Walmart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pull into the Walmart parking lot. There’s a group of idling semi trucks. I drive around them to the center of the lot, where there’s a big open area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I eat my burger and fries. The parking lot has an artificial light; it’s another planet. The clouds are thick and reflect the pale orange of the distant city. Something will probably happen, I think. Things eventually happen. You don’t ever have to do anything. People think you have to make things happen, make your life happen, but life happens to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mall’s outer wall, the face of the Walmart, bleeds upward into the night sky. There is no discernable boundary between it and its background, between the thing and its opposite. John would appreciate this, the magnitude and smallness of everything all at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, in a rush, it comes to me that I could start a diner, an old-timey diner.
