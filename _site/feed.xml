        <title>Peut être</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My boy wears grease that &lt;br /&gt;
smells like cinnamon in his hair.&lt;br /&gt;
It lingers on the pillows &lt;br /&gt;
and I don’t want to forget that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There aren’t any squash in the garden but&lt;br /&gt;
the blooms sure look pretty&lt;br /&gt;
like springtime tender&lt;br /&gt;
even in the eleventh month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When there is rose &lt;br /&gt;
lemonade at the market&lt;br /&gt;
and when there are curbsides &lt;br /&gt;
bathed in sunlight, &lt;br /&gt;
maybe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Parade Is Not Diplomacy</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s an egg in the dark&lt;br /&gt;
and somebody talking to you.&lt;br /&gt;
An egg in the dark and a man—&lt;br /&gt;
you—under the shut sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When somebody calls you all light up&lt;br /&gt;
and walk the shores in rows&lt;br /&gt;
like untrustworthy mushrooms.&lt;br /&gt;
You are more scattered than a row&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and devour the flank&lt;br /&gt;
after the battle. You take it down together&lt;br /&gt;
and peel back the flank&lt;br /&gt;
of the animal. Fur glued to paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paper glued to the backs of your hands.&lt;br /&gt;
“It’s like it nourishes me.”&lt;br /&gt;
You finally get to be sad like the moon,&lt;br /&gt;
together. Everybody is mad at each other!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t know them! You&lt;br /&gt;
know the sand. It’s thick,&lt;br /&gt;
like silt. Your characters exit,&lt;br /&gt;
presumably to have sex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You finally believe your luck&lt;br /&gt;
sitting across from a great actress, who says,&lt;br /&gt;
“Being with other people will ruin your life.&lt;br /&gt;
Always should, always has to, always will.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Some Spirits Have Been around Longer Than Other Spirits</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The universe is doing well. There are many planets. There are many planets we cannot see. Planets with names like MOA-2007-BLG-192Lb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Milky Way galaxy there are 100 to 400 billion planets. If you want to name a planet you can. Name it anything you want. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A person on Earth looks at a computer screen. The person is Larry Page. Larry Page has named two planets. Larry Page is looking at his computer screen thinking about eternity, non-existence, prostate cancer. Larry Page is going to die. In his next life, he hopes to be a Solitary Eagle, Harpyhaliaetus solitarius. He will live in South America, soar above the Peruvian rain forest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, a person in a two-bedroom house watches a movie and laughs. Another person hides under a blanket and reads. Between the visible stars are more stars. Between Larry Page and the tree is twenty feet. Between Larry Page’s mind and the world is his skin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i digged graves&lt;br /&gt;
subsisted on bones&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;crushed tomatos&lt;br /&gt;

        <title>SOMETIMES THERE ARE MEN</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I suck my teeth at you&lt;br /&gt;
and hear the clinking of keys&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a lemon in my mouth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to be forgiven&lt;br /&gt;
but now I am not&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;an edge&lt;br /&gt;
that rounded itself&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;there are windows everywhere I go&lt;br /&gt;
but I hardly ever count them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have never felt closer to god&lt;br /&gt;
than when I smile at a TV show&lt;br /&gt;
or maybe a child&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the best things&lt;br /&gt;
are when it is quiet&lt;br /&gt;
and I am alone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I already know what your mouth tastes like:&lt;br /&gt;
the forest floor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in short,&lt;br /&gt;
wet.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>city</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I.	city&lt;br /&gt;
Where lives are controlled thru threats &lt;br /&gt;
Drugs and violence. The audience&lt;br /&gt;
hold crosses. Its ignorance  holds &lt;br /&gt; 
Down the universe twisting  fingers. At night &lt;br /&gt;
My arms hold multi colored crystals. My black &lt;br /&gt;
Gloves like a symbol of God holds the addicts.&lt;br /&gt;
My friend’s think I’m a painter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;II.&lt;br /&gt;
My name is Sunday. I survived &lt;br /&gt;
Being a movie star. I felt  pain too much &lt;br /&gt;
To be embarrassed. I’ve been the unemployed &lt;br /&gt;
Friend. Quiet  dark and wrinkled. On  &lt;br /&gt;
My stomach to soften my hunger. Good bye &lt;br /&gt;
Not  the final word. If you believe that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;III.&lt;br /&gt;
And suddenly &lt;br /&gt;
Breaking into sunrise. I came crying.&lt;br /&gt;
I repeated all that happened. I was &lt;br /&gt;
In back seat when the car pulled over.&lt;br /&gt;
An explosive human stampede&lt;br /&gt;
Happening on my ribs and head&lt;br /&gt;
Police stripped me out two grams&lt;br /&gt;
And dragged along the empty street&lt;br /&gt;
My lips wet with blood, I thought,&lt;br /&gt;
This my murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IV&lt;br /&gt;
Dying is an ancient disgrace like painting &lt;br /&gt;
Poetry art literature. It’s dumb.  When I wake &lt;br /&gt;
Up. Tell me you will  reach. Tell me you will &lt;br /&gt;
Recognize. Tell me you will take&lt;br /&gt;
 me to bed instead of your husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;V.&lt;br /&gt;
The faint sound of sirens connects me&lt;br /&gt;
To this place. It’s a  place that reminds  us &lt;br /&gt;
Of Egypt. The children chew tobacco weed &lt;br /&gt;
Leaves &lt;br /&gt;
And marshmallows produce  a sap &lt;br /&gt;
Used to heal wounds.  Everyone watching&lt;br /&gt;
Everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>2 poems</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I Don’t Know How to Say This in Your Language&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rain is drift-falling and layers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;cannot save you from this winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the sidewalk, an African immigrant&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;leans against concrete, his Air&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jordans leathered and grounded&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in a shift of faces. I wonder&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if there is an art to dying&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;young—if Turkish food markets&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;remind us good times aren’t forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Castles have fallen here but some&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;still watchdog the Spree,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;pushing back against snow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we arrived to a&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;chestpunch of dark and cups of red&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;wine. We walked&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to the farside until we no longer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;knew ourselves, until they looked at us&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for our tongues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Millennial Walks into a Bar and Says:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start off with a Disney movie because why&lt;br /&gt;
shouldn’t we? The one where the boy gets sucked&lt;br /&gt;
into the game his father created. Virtual reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And let’s consider how there is an invisibility to&lt;br /&gt;
everything. The way voices can break airwaves across &lt;br /&gt;
oceans slapping against us. And let’s disregard&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the tsunami ripples. Who takes responsibility for this, anyways?&lt;br /&gt;
It’s an American thing to scream out take no prisoners in public. If not,&lt;br /&gt;
it should be. Think of national security threats. Anonymous hackers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;who break code. I asked my students what they thought&lt;br /&gt;
about this and they told me about plaid shirts, the lag&lt;br /&gt;
of internet, Wreckin’ Ralph. I’ve mentioned&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;another Disney movie I haven’t seen.&lt;br /&gt;
But I sometimes worry about oil pipelines in North Dakota.&lt;br /&gt;
About congress evil-scheming behind&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;us. They will plant lemon trees&lt;br /&gt;
in our backyards and it’ll be okay. This is approval &lt;br /&gt;
by majority so sit back and watch that shit grow. I apologize&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if nothing bothers you. I am easily bothered. This brings me&lt;br /&gt;
back to lemon trees and oil pipelines. Doesn’t this seem&lt;br /&gt;
like Planet of the Apes? What if Charlton Heston was telling us&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;something when he said “I’m sending my last signal&lt;br /&gt;
to Earth before we reach our destination.”&lt;br /&gt;
This is a rough paraphrase. What isn’t rough?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When they discovered neon it was accidental.&lt;br /&gt;
When they discovered continents it was accidental.&lt;br /&gt;
When they discovered race it was accidental.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe not. Maybe I’m saying history&lt;br /&gt;
isn’t orchestrated by a perfect God. &lt;br /&gt;
We are byproducts of earthquakes. And English&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;is commonly spoken everywhere. Does anyone&lt;br /&gt;
care that it started with rape?&lt;br /&gt;
Sometimes I speak in a voice that isn’t mine. Maybe &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it’s yours. I apologize. I apologize a lot. I apologize&lt;br /&gt;
for apologizing so much. In the 1940s&lt;br /&gt;
a group of teenage boys were used&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for experiments during the Holocaust. I learned about them&lt;br /&gt;
during our tour of a death camp in Oranienburg.&lt;br /&gt;
How the Germans kept them around for scientific purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How those boys outlived German lieutenants. Poetic justice&lt;br /&gt;
some might say. Meanwhile in the South Bronx teenagers&lt;br /&gt;
built cultures from wax, DJed inside broken&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;down project buildings and spit fluids into crowds&lt;br /&gt;
who kept their hands up until the break of dawn. A breaking&lt;br /&gt;
dance motion. Contortion of the spirit. Head spins. Nothing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;like U.S. military drones missing their targets. Nothing.&lt;br /&gt;
But everything like jazz quartets. In New Orleans&lt;br /&gt;
there are streets that have retained the noises of ghosts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tchoupitoulas; Calliope; St. Claude. Find me&lt;br /&gt;
there. I want to remix the wrongs and make a mixtape&lt;br /&gt;
of imperfections. Put it in your stereo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let your older brother get drunk to it. Let your grandmother&lt;br /&gt;
fall asleep to this. Dreams are the origin of an end.&lt;br /&gt;
Think about it. Flying cars and robots that act and look&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;fakingly real. Am I wrong for this? I really can’t say&lt;br /&gt;
I’m Mexican just as I really can’t say&lt;br /&gt;
I’m American. Someone built this bridge between me. They carved&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;hyphens from the air for me to cross. Not just the crossings&lt;br /&gt;
you might be thinking. But the sort that can birth multiples: &lt;br /&gt;
national borders, a puzzle, holy crucifixions, movements&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;across disparate bodies. I apologize again. I just did that thing&lt;br /&gt;
when you use a word in your definition to define another word.&lt;br /&gt;
I’m sure language is empired from mistakes so&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d rather not take this to you. It might stifle what my friend Stan&lt;br /&gt;
calls moon-guzzling. Instead, keep jogging until you reach&lt;br /&gt;
the edge of yourself. And jump off. And find pleasure between your falling breaths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The week before Obama’s presidency ended we drove&lt;br /&gt;
to Half Moon Bay. There was 80s synthpop and a flood&lt;br /&gt;
of trap wave playing. I found a decayed bunker on a cliffside:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;aqua graffiti letters spelled INNA TRIBE. Yesterday,&lt;br /&gt;
I ate ribs at a mom and pop’s in Hayward. The talk of teaching,&lt;br /&gt;
of weddings, the slow goodness of slow-cooked BBQ inside us. Nobody&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;flinches. Imagine Jeff Chang and Chinaka Hodge hurling poems&lt;br /&gt;
at the heads of protestors in our streets while something burns&lt;br /&gt;
in the near distance. Orange horizons to remind us of unbroken nights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember to drive slow and pump your brakes. An orchestra of Kanye.&lt;br /&gt;
Shakir from West Oakland singing Italian operas—California&lt;br /&gt;
house parties. Not like what you see in movies. Or maybe&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it is. We were born here and raised up like the Redwoods. Who asked?&lt;br /&gt;
Moving on, our neighbors are new and the old ones just moved out.&lt;br /&gt;
Not always by choice. How does space change over time? It’s just time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;they say. I don’t talk with my mom much because she bounces&lt;br /&gt;
around, this time to LA. Video games are her pleasure. In Dragon Age Inquisition&lt;br /&gt;
you play as a character who hunts dragons and has sex with others—&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;she explained this to me. I’ve never owned a PS4 though. In the magazine Wired&lt;br /&gt;
you can read about two sisters from Seattle, ages 9 and 11, who built a Do-It-Yourself&lt;br /&gt;
spacecraft out of simple materials, used a GoPro to capture its ascent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;into the blindness of space. It’s all on YouTube. I wonder&lt;br /&gt;
if our imaginations get wrinkled and weary like adults. I wonder&lt;br /&gt;
if things are really things. I’d bet that all things eventually change&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;because someone didn’t want them to. (i.e. Civil Rights). How this&lt;br /&gt;
can all pour from my fingers in a matter of minutes. Like newspapers&lt;br /&gt;
becoming outdated. We mostly use Facebook as a source of news, anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entertainment doesn’t hide itself from us very well. At the gym,&lt;br /&gt;
why do we look so discomfortable? At bars, why&lt;br /&gt;
do we look so discomfortable? This is rude of me to ask on a first date,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been told. Perhaps the salad would have been a better choice.&lt;br /&gt;
Locally foraged, says the 8-pt. font menu. Some of us would rather eat strawberries&lt;br /&gt;
at home while watching Trevor Noah. Note to self: do this on a Wednesday night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, they need this. Remember, you need this. Everyday&lt;br /&gt;
is a remembering of too many things. That’s why we keep calendars.&lt;br /&gt;
Maybe I’ll cancel our plans and see what tomorrow shapes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Fear, O Shakespeare</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A thousand paper butterflies shed –&lt;br /&gt;
skin, hair locked onto shoulders bare&lt;br /&gt;
in cabins cornered you see, They see&lt;br /&gt;
darkest of dreams, brightest of nightmares, They&lt;br /&gt;
tromp and stumble like unordered stringencies –&lt;br /&gt;
nameless, faceless wings and things&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;playing games on damask and toile, toiling with untethered&lt;br /&gt;
tassels and troughs, wretched bobbins and thimbles &lt;br /&gt;
misplaced and mislead&lt;br /&gt;
molasses mouse traps and maidens drowned –&lt;br /&gt;
and ants feast on dead ends of Her&lt;br /&gt;
and blood on sodden handkerchiefs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;William, your harpy’s here&lt;br /&gt;
and heaven is far away&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Highly Sensitive People</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am seated at a dinner table, surrounded by old friends. My posture is upright and leaning forward. Everyone is laughing. John says he has an aversion to birds, but he likes toucans because they have commercial appeal. John’s cultural high mark is always commercial appeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My palms are clammy. I excuse myself and go to the bathroom. The window is open and I look out at the big wilting oak in the backyard. Its leaves shake and tremble. There is a big smeared sky. The sun goes down over the horizon, pixelated and snuffed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m really gawking, having a hard time accepting it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bathroom has an aquatic theme, seashells on all surfaces. There is a skin-pink conch, a bowl of shimmering abalone, a jar of sea foam air freshener. I turn on the hot water. It runs over my hands. 
Back in the dining room, John’s wife, Asmanti, who goes by Aasra, says, “I like the shiny fruit, the glossy ones.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John seizes the moment: “Commercial appeal.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ask if they want to play a board game. They say they would. I put three boxes on the kitchen table and ask them to pick. John, Paige, and I agree on Monopoly, but Aasra says she doesn’t have all night. We chat. Aasra seems detached and spacey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think my dad has Alzheimer’s,” she says. “He loses things. His keys, his wallet. It’s not the losing but the searching.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Doesn’t seem too extra bad, honey,” John says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aasra turns to him. Frustrated, she says, “You think death is for old people.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John looks confused, like a boy being punished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all agree we’re tired and say our goodbyes. I’m standing alone with Paige. The driveway is enormous and the street is quiet in the way autumn is quiet. Mounds of brown and rotten leaves populate the lawn, softening the rattle of the highway. I ask if she needs a ride home. It’s a dumb question considering we’re in the suburbs and how would she have gotten here. She says she drove, but that I could bodyguard her to her car. She says it like that, with bodyguard being a verb. “A piggyback?” I say, turning my shoulder down and crouching. It’s funnier as a thought in my head, in a perfect scenario. She punches my arm. It’s hard enough that I feel a sting. “What do you think about John,” she says, like he’s changed or something. “I don’t know,” I say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She thinks he’s confident in a way that worries her. She says I’m overly quiet—I could use some of whatever John has. I do an impression, “Commercial appeal.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Toucans,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At her car we hug. I can’t tell if she’s hugging me tighter than usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s early morning and the freeway is empty. I let the car drift, take up space. I chant the names of lawyers on billboards—Ahaab, Guntner, Niedecker—godlike and stern. On the radio, DJ Plato experiments with noises that rail and reverse, birthed from motherboards. The car’s tires peel against asphalt, producing a long endless rip. The dimples, the potholes, the quiet of the repaved sections. The high pitch of the thin, parallel grooves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m at home watching PBS with Anna. We’ve been together for six years. The program is about the Roosevelt family and their patrician ambitions. I think about my life and all my average ambitions, my girlfriend’s average ambitions, my friends’ average ambitions, the overall ease of it. Anna is at the other end of the couch. She stares at me until I look back at her. I focus on the TV. She says the Roosevelts cared so much; they cared so much about everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anna and I exist in a world that doesn’t resemble what we’d expected. Initially we went at our relationship in a focused way. There was a side-by-side feeling. In time we sputtered, made tiny adjustments in degree that grew to unsaid distances. Now it’s lonely and painful and neither of us knows what to do to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Maybe the Roosevelts don’t count,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theodore Roosevelt’s wife and mother died on the same day. His wife died in childbirth and his mother from typhoid fever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That day,” says Ken Burns, “Roosevelt wrote in his journal a single sentence that revealed more about his inner life than any other entry: ‘Today, the light has gone out of my life.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I drive to San Ramon where I know of an In-N-Out. I call Paige but she doesn’t answer. At In-N-Out I get animal fries. My phone rings. I let it ring without answering. I call her back and it goes to voicemail, so I say something about a movie that I want to see and that she might also want to see. “Communicate through voicemail,” I think. “It’s not cheating if we don’t speak directly.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I drive past my exit. I can’t go home yet. Eventually there’s the Best Buy, the Michaels, the Walmart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pull into the Walmart parking lot. There’s a group of idling semi trucks. I drive around them to the center of the lot, where there’s a big open area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I eat my burger and fries. The parking lot has an artificial light; it’s another planet. The clouds are thick and reflect the pale orange of the distant city. Something will probably happen, I think. Things eventually happen. You don’t ever have to do anything. People think you have to make things happen, make your life happen, but life happens to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mall’s outer wall, the face of the Walmart, bleeds upward into the night sky. There is no discernable boundary between it and its background, between the thing and its opposite. John would appreciate this, the magnitude and smallness of everything all at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, in a rush, it comes to me that I could start a diner, an old-timey diner. It takes all my imaginative power to play out a scenario in which I explain to a regular customer that I had hoped to be a writer, but I’d given it up to run this diner. Not a patrician ambition, but an ambition nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The customer’s face is round, almost swollen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“True,” I say. “Time is money. Money is time. Speaking of money, I’ve got some bad news. The burger special—the cost of beef has really skyrocketed—it’s up to $14.50.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His face grows larger; I’m worried he’ll be upset. 
“No problem, bucko,” he says, slapping my shoulder. 
Condensation clouds the windshield. A semi starts its engine. I draw a smiley face with my knuckle and look out of its mouth. A driver hops down from his cab. He stands there, stretches his arms and punches the air, his breath silver and becoming.&lt;/p&gt;
