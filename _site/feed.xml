        <title>Manchester Street</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I almost miss the cacophony  &lt;br /&gt;
of Brash Crashing syllables &lt;br /&gt;
that New England &lt;br /&gt;
way of sounding &lt;br /&gt;
off on the street  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;that porch on Manchester &lt;br /&gt;
Street, that apartment &lt;br /&gt;
with carbon dioxide sneaking in &lt;br /&gt;
with the heat, &lt;br /&gt;
filling rooms in a drowsy fog  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the street lights buzzing clementines &lt;br /&gt;
above the neighbor who has fallen &lt;br /&gt;
drunkenly in the street &lt;br /&gt;
and a band &lt;br /&gt;
of angry rescuers&lt;br /&gt;
Yell and drag at him  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in the confusion   half a dream, I was resigned to  &lt;br /&gt;
the mess of it all &lt;br /&gt;
A dash of freckled sun &lt;br /&gt;
that was you in the winter  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By spring the sky unfolded&lt;br /&gt;  
and I was gone&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I Misremember</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The wedding and the ugly tux with mauve &lt;br /&gt; 
Pinstripes. Who fell asleep. They rode away on blue bicycles &lt;br /&gt; 
Very straight. I got meat lovers pizza. I misremember &lt;br /&gt; 
The color of the bra. Or the number of ice cubes &lt;br /&gt; 
I sucked down whole. I was seven. Or post-first cavity&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Filling feeling. I misremember the flavor of popsicle &lt;br /&gt; 
I sucked. Grape or green. What is the peach. &lt;br /&gt; 
The sound of a hand on my hair. Or the tiny green camper.&lt;br /&gt; 
It was on fire. I awoke saying I know somebody is dying. &lt;br /&gt; 
I awoke saying Somebody I know is dying. &lt;br /&gt; 
Jeep Wrangler exiting my gullet as it exited&lt;br /&gt; 
The yard. I misremember which night gown my mother wore.&lt;br /&gt; 
The hearts or the teddy bears. &lt;br /&gt; 
The wallpaper was yellow or pink. &lt;br /&gt; 
Or the number of deer heads they displayed  &lt;br /&gt; 
At the funeral. They certainly each shone  &lt;br /&gt; 
On the wall. The feel of the end  &lt;br /&gt; 
Of October. A hotel with everything indoors. &lt;br /&gt; 
I misremember the size of my penis. &lt;br /&gt; 
Who was there. Who was laughing. &lt;br /&gt; 
My dad literally fishing  &lt;br /&gt; 
My trunks from the deep end. Which uncle &lt;br /&gt; 
Chomping tobacco the color of his horses. &lt;br /&gt; 
I misremember the first chicken I killed. &lt;br /&gt; 
The smell of pot in the car. The song playing. &lt;br /&gt; 
The primary means of fire those days. &lt;br /&gt; 
I ate chicken legs and I puked on Christmas Eve. &lt;br /&gt; 
Which year and which chicken.&lt;br /&gt; 
I misremember how I misremember. &lt;br /&gt; 
Who brought the mac and cheese to Thanksgiving. &lt;br /&gt; 
Who only naps on holidays. Or what reason &lt;br /&gt; 
My uncle said for never shaving. I misremember what &lt;br /&gt; 
Teen brought the secret champagne for sunset.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>eddie goode-shaman learns about death</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i remember anne&lt;br /&gt;
mostly as a voice&lt;br /&gt;
on the phone or &lt;br /&gt;
a body curled over&lt;br /&gt;
the kitchen counter&lt;br /&gt;
crying at the end&lt;br /&gt;
of something i was&lt;br /&gt;
too young to understand&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it turns out she died&lt;br /&gt;
4 years ago&lt;br /&gt;
somewhere in nevada&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i didnít even know &lt;br /&gt;
she’d moved&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;poets and outlaws as &lt;br /&gt;
sparkling fuses between&lt;br /&gt;
the beating of wings&lt;br /&gt;
and the blinking of&lt;br /&gt;
buzzards in a desert&lt;br /&gt;
no oneís bothered to name&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and later, pieces of harold&lt;br /&gt;
lloydís hand in the&lt;br /&gt;
prop bucket&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and youíll never have to work again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;eddie finds a few &lt;br /&gt;
factoids and lorca’s &lt;br /&gt;
left eye on the&lt;br /&gt;
clearance rack in&lt;br /&gt;
the curiosity shop&lt;br /&gt;
of the human heart&lt;br /&gt;
they pay for themselves&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and he walks out into&lt;br /&gt;
the world w/ a new found&lt;br /&gt;
faith in the christian work &lt;br /&gt;
ethic and lorca’s left &lt;br /&gt;
eye in his back pocket&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the squealing of tires&lt;br /&gt;
and monday morning hung-over&lt;br /&gt;
moaning of would be&lt;br /&gt;
olympians manages to&lt;br /&gt;
keep the birds away&lt;br /&gt;
in a city where all&lt;br /&gt;
the signs read&lt;br /&gt;
fuck you        pay me&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Slowly</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Let us take all the long time we need&lt;br /&gt;
To wake up from our overdue dreams&lt;br /&gt;
Get out of the bed, and stretch our&lt;br /&gt;
Limbs as far as possible for a new morning&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us take all the long time we need&lt;br /&gt;
To listen to the first song of the birds&lt;br /&gt;
Watch the rise of this summer sun, feel&lt;br /&gt;
The breeze combing each tree with tenderness&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us take all the long time we need&lt;br /&gt;
To enjoy being together with our beloved&lt;br /&gt;
Exchange a smile so that they can stay with&lt;br /&gt;
Us just a few seconds or even minutes longer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, let’s take all the long time we need&lt;br /&gt;
To drink this tea, to chat about this weather&lt;br /&gt;
To look back at the road we have travelled along&lt;br /&gt;
To think, to cry, and to die in lingering twilight&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>some may call it a goat farm but i called it march beside you</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;i love you more than that train car &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;amp; the things you made me feel in it &lt;br /&gt;
made me feel like the train car&lt;br /&gt;
(stained by clay/spring heat)&lt;br /&gt;
(filled with abandoned wasps’&lt;br /&gt;
nests you filled with cigarette&lt;br /&gt;
breath til it dripped out like &lt;br /&gt;
spit down your pretty mouth)&lt;br /&gt;
(like some day a couple o’&lt;br /&gt;
kids might just fall in love &lt;br /&gt;
within my red rotting wood,&lt;br /&gt;
their hands not touching but&lt;br /&gt;
held somehow–i remember&lt;br /&gt;
something in a science class&lt;br /&gt;
about how we’re all always&lt;br /&gt;
touching if you think about&lt;br /&gt;
the body as a magnet &amp;amp; &lt;br /&gt;
since i’ve met you i’ve been&lt;br /&gt;
thinking about my body as&lt;br /&gt;
one of those little wooden&lt;br /&gt;
train cars with the magnets &lt;br /&gt;
on either end &amp;amp; you as a &lt;br /&gt;
train car with a magnet on &lt;br /&gt;
both ends &amp;amp; my heart’s a &lt;br /&gt;
little kid with hands that &lt;br /&gt;
keep pushing us together &lt;br /&gt;
somewhere behind or &lt;br /&gt;
beyond the tracks, beyond&lt;br /&gt;
the smoke)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>2 Prose Poems</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equinox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A deranged tourist plans to slash any paintings in a gold frame. It’s easy to do. The vulture lifts him to the other side of the abyss. And so the God of our fathers tumbles out of the sky. Given how much is going on, more than a few friends botch their latest suicide attempts. I pull the cushions off the couch, the books off the shelves, try to pull up the floorboards with my bare hands. Tomorrow, if not today, spring will follow, a small, wildly twitching snake between its legs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security Questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was your childhood nickname? What was the last name of your third grade teacher? What is the first name of the boy or girl that you first kissed? Almost anyone – a shoelace vendor, clerical staff, Peruvian neo-Maoists – can guess the answers. It’s easier than you think. The fact is, they know why you keep stopping what you’re doing to stare with various degrees of consternation at your phone. Better for all if you turn up the collar of your coat, hide your face behind dark glasses, and walk faster, a lot faster, like Sartre when he thought he was being followed down the street by lobsters.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Happy Birthday Baby</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote that, I wrote the baby part and I don’t know why&lt;br /&gt;
It felt kind of butch, it felt like putting all my fingers in&lt;br /&gt;
your mouth, it felt like penetration&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you can skim-read me, don’t worry&lt;br /&gt;
I say I love you like it’s water, like I&lt;br /&gt;
would die in three days without&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Paradise</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I say &lt;em&gt;aspen&lt;/em&gt; meaning &lt;em&gt;elm&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;br /&gt;
speak of the cottonwood. &lt;br /&gt;
The boy was not in love with &lt;br /&gt;
trains as the other boys were, &lt;br /&gt;
and ran from their distant &lt;br /&gt;
noise in terror, ran until a &lt;br /&gt;
parent scooped him up and &lt;br /&gt;
hugged him near. &lt;em&gt;Harmless&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt;, she whispers. Red is not, &lt;br /&gt;
however, obviously endless. I &lt;br /&gt;
watched three men grill three &lt;br /&gt;
rows of sausages each on &lt;br /&gt;
three grills facing the beach.&lt;br /&gt; 
That was the morning after &lt;br /&gt;
the earthquake article, and &lt;br /&gt;
we all felt somewhat older. &lt;br /&gt;
Uncommon seeing. A habit &lt;br /&gt;
imbues what is hope with &lt;br /&gt;
actual practice.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What I Talk About When I Don&#39;t Want to Talk About Katrina</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Having a cat, used to talking&lt;br /&gt;
to myself, there is a limit&lt;br /&gt;
on how much catastrophe&lt;br /&gt;
we can handle. 34 left&lt;br /&gt;
at the nursing home to die&lt;br /&gt;
fell on the bad side.&lt;br /&gt;
Since when are we satisfied&lt;br /&gt;
with a slow gouge without&lt;br /&gt;
resolution and revelation&lt;br /&gt;
of the emotion at play?&lt;br /&gt;
There was a time when she&lt;br /&gt;
cranked up the category, as if&lt;br /&gt;
to say, Hey this is what a body&lt;br /&gt;
looks like turned inside out!&lt;br /&gt;
(I am talking to myself again)&lt;br /&gt;
I reconcile that slush-thrower&lt;br /&gt;
peeling back the city’s onion-&lt;br /&gt;
strata with no space for grave-&lt;br /&gt;
yards to stack bodies in layers.&lt;br /&gt;
I’ve made sandwiches before,&lt;br /&gt;
all the while talking to my cat,&lt;br /&gt;
waiting for its backtalk.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Opheim</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I tried on a dress &lt;br /&gt;
at Zara.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a selfie of my&lt;br /&gt;
spaciousness&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;inside&lt;br /&gt;
Of It.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t buy it.&lt;br /&gt;
Even though I wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I &lt;br /&gt;
had the Power to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but I wanted to&lt;br /&gt;
Buy It.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rage, rage&lt;br /&gt;
against your&lt;br /&gt;
inner capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rage, rage &lt;br /&gt;
deep in the fist&lt;br /&gt;
of your Softness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spotify is trying to get me&lt;br /&gt;
to listen to my ex’s music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I’m all like&lt;br /&gt;
‘Only&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if the songs are all about &lt;br /&gt;
how amazing I am’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But really I’m just like ‘nah’.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t listen.&lt;br /&gt;
even though I want to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I&lt;br /&gt;
have the power to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I do want to&lt;br /&gt;
Hear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel Real&lt;br /&gt;
waiting for the metro&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;with other real people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you do it?&lt;br /&gt;
I think at them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How are you so good&lt;br /&gt;
at being a human?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Loft&lt;br /&gt;
people are doing stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Casually asking for money&lt;br /&gt;
without having done anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel real&lt;br /&gt;
but imaginary as well&lt;br /&gt;
somehow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel shy about&lt;br /&gt;
reciprocating this Feeling&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t let out&lt;br /&gt;
Yet.&lt;/p&gt;
