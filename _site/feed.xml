        <title>Don&#39;t Hurt Yourself</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I bought pepper spray yesterday cause it was $10&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;amp; bedazzled. It’s still in the box on the kitchen&lt;br /&gt;
table. When I met Adam I was wearing a&lt;br /&gt;
halo cause it was Halloween. I gave it to him cause&lt;br /&gt;
he was turning 22 at midnight and also&lt;br /&gt;
probably I fell in love or maybe out of the sky&lt;br /&gt;
or both. We had so many sleepovers. We ordered&lt;br /&gt;
so much Chinese food. We were so sad about&lt;br /&gt;
money. Kelsey was followed home twice &amp;amp;&lt;br /&gt;
that was when I liked her so I was really empathetic.&lt;br /&gt;
She has a knife with a cat on it even though&lt;br /&gt;
she’s more of a dog person.  I have bedazzled&lt;br /&gt;
pepper spray recommended by Cosmo&lt;br /&gt;
in a plastic box on my kitchen table even though&lt;br /&gt;
I’m more of a person who’s scared all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Cheese Toast</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;S01E01&lt;br /&gt;
“Everyone loves cheese toast,” said the TV judge. The contestant was safe, again. Not on top. She seethed with anger at cheddar and bread.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
S01E02&lt;br /&gt;
“Everyone loves cheese toast,” said the judge on the reality TV show. The chef beamed. It was made with spray cheese and garlic crostini.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
S01E03&lt;br /&gt;
“Everyone loves cheese toast,” said the main judge from the reality show. “But what you’ve done here grating 5 cheeses was amazing. A win.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
S01E04&lt;br /&gt;
“Everyone loves cheese toast,” said the reality show judge, “Have you had a glass of water? Go grab one!” The water board paid her 100K.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
S01E05&lt;br /&gt;
“Everyone loves cheese toast,” said the TV show judge, “But we’re tired of seeing it from you. Please pack your pots and pans, and go home.”&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>100 years of ineptitude</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Walking around like some dude with nothing to do, unaware of the current inner workings of my own mind.
All the people around don’t know anything, they’re so dumb.
Parachuting molly in Washington Sq. Park, I tell Audrey that I like stupid people, I just wish they were a little smarter.
“That’s the thing about the moon,” Audrey says, “if I wanted to, nothing could stop me from going there.”
I look up and mumble, “Jesus,” under my breath, “it’s like blankets,” I say, “the atmosphere, sky, it’s fucking blankets.”
Feeling not high enough, me and Audrey go back home to insufflate more MDMA where she asks about my first memory.
“A picnic,” I say, “with my mom and someone else, I don’t remember.”
“Stupid,” she says. 
I display a disconcerted facial expression.
“Stupid memories,” she says to herself, “they don’t mean anything to anyone.”
On our way to the reading, I’m thinking about puddles and other bodies of water when a man punches me in the back of the head.
“Excuse me,” I say before laughing and walking away.
“Where do you think you’re going, motherfucker?” He says, “I’ll get you in your sleep!”
“Fuck off, Jerk-ass!” Audrey yells as the whole future feels like it’s opening up right in front of me.
“That was cool,” I observe.
“It was cool and kind of funny,” Audrey responds in the immediate aftermath.
We finally make it to the reading where Sarah pleads with me, “Theo, stop patting my back when we hug, just hug me for real!”
We’re all conversing within a group when Rachel jokingly says, “Where did my parents go wrong?”
“That’s a good tweet,” I say.
“That is a good tweet!” she rehashes. 
After a mercifully short list of readers, me and Audrey go to the roof to smoke weed.
“It’s beautiful up here.”
“Roofs don’t really do anything for me,” she says.
“In the summertime, I’ll go on my roof everyday.”
“I’m not saying they’re bad, they’re just nothing special. I guess I enjoy the perspective, but-“
“I wasn’t trying to argue,” I say.
“It feels like you are.”
Waiting in line for the bathroom, Henry notes that not only are the current occupants probably doing drugs, but we also plan to do the same.
“It’s always so nice seeing you,” I tell him after sharing a laugh.
“I love you, Theo,” he says, his eyes becoming dull, “in confusing ways.”
“Thats,” I pause, “good to know.”
Showing off to Audrey, I hop down the last three steps of the stoop and shout, “I give tonight a 7/10!”
Discussing the recent meaningful interactions on our way home, I think about how how this time last year I was in San Francisco.
The hills toppled around like sedated seagulls, there was a lot of yellow and pink, even nicer things probably.
It’s weird how I always feel like the same person until I think about stuff for a little while.
“You never pay any attention to me,” Audrey says as it starts to rain.
I sincerely apologize to her.
“Rain, rain,” she says a few times until her voice quiets to a low murmur, “this is a secret to everyone asleep.”
The next day, I wake up and it feels distinctly like a fade-in, or maybe a very long dissolve, through waking, pooping, showering whilst singing, dressing too long, coffee-ing, smoking, eating, smoking, talking too loudly, whispering unnecessarily, wondering hopefully, sleeping maybe.
Ugh, I don’t want to get out of bed, there’s nothing to do and it’s all so hard.
My roommate’s cats tip a glass off the coffee table and look me in the eyes.
“Bastards,” I whisper dramatically and laugh.
I visualize laughter as something akin to magnetic waves that intensifies in proximity to domesticated animals.
“Holy shit,” I realize, “I can apply meaning to anything.”
I stare out the window at a spot on the neighboring building, a group of bricks midway between two third floor windows, and think to myself, “This must be it, this must be meaning.”&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Three Poems</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Untitled&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was a fountain choreographer&lt;br /&gt;
in purple sheets, given to glass worship.&lt;br /&gt;
I was statues, too, broken down to chips,&lt;br /&gt;
when the rumor died down at the altar.&lt;br /&gt;
Elle ordered me (again) to Love My Hair,&lt;br /&gt;
when France and Russia fought over warships,&lt;br /&gt;
when we were two people meant to Ketchup;&lt;br /&gt;
but wasn’t that your job? (I mean, the hair).&lt;br /&gt;
Back when I spent my money on Moleskines -&lt;br /&gt;
they still write, to ask me if I want more.&lt;br /&gt;
I don’t know how to answer such questions,&lt;br /&gt;
so instead I tell them I want more skin,&lt;br /&gt;
because we stretched the rumor till it tore,&lt;br /&gt;
and then left it to yellow in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Marbles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The morning after the cow lost her calf,&lt;br /&gt;
the symptoms set in.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The planarian split into two,&lt;br /&gt;
3.4 miles from shore.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The slanted city/a spineless island,&lt;br /&gt;
sent the marbles on a downward roll.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then with the drill (it’s a hands-on city):&lt;br /&gt;
don’t fix the shelves, please, just fill in the hole.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When I fell, I felled the topography.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You misunderstood me a hundred times,&lt;br /&gt;
yet here I am again, infralapsing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So: there was your way and there was mine,&lt;br /&gt;
respecting our original parting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Buried under a tree came back bolder:&lt;br /&gt;
that bell I found. Remember? I told you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Windows&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They are all talking about &lt;br /&gt;
the storm windows &lt;br /&gt;
but none of them saw &lt;br /&gt;
the note on the sink,&lt;br /&gt;
the one that kept it to storms,&lt;br /&gt;
on how to condition the storms &lt;br /&gt;
for storms. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And while they sign off in the copse,&lt;br /&gt;
through their talk of squalls&lt;br /&gt;
comes our daughter’s voice, &lt;br /&gt;
supplicating the raspberries, &lt;br /&gt;
those that dilly-dallied into September, &lt;br /&gt;
so old they taste like jam. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The woman who lived here &lt;br /&gt;
made her nest in a town &lt;br /&gt;
kept honest by wood.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Now an auctioneer codes &lt;br /&gt;
a shovel full of buttons&lt;br /&gt;
rested on a child’s sled &lt;br /&gt;
and a julep Rabbit,&lt;br /&gt;
68,000 miles tired. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It reminds me of a cabinet &lt;br /&gt;
where birds were laid to rest &lt;br /&gt;
in cotton balls. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No one is really from this town&lt;br /&gt;
and the only wood to ever come from here &lt;br /&gt;
was splintered, dipped in sulphur, &lt;br /&gt;
and inflamed against diminutive &lt;br /&gt;
adirondack chairs. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Our daughter pockets an acorn,&lt;br /&gt;
convincing us both she has taken &lt;br /&gt;
something valuable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Dear Sal</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Sal,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In a room on the river &lt;br /&gt;
we crooned hymns &lt;br /&gt;
to honeysuckle, eulogized &lt;br /&gt;
a stuffed trout, carved nectarines &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;amp; waltzed within &lt;br /&gt;
the scent. You fed me &lt;br /&gt;
dark bread slathered in butter &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;amp; I did not speak of &lt;br /&gt;
the French, the Germans, my mouth &lt;br /&gt;
too full of sweetnesses. Your steady hands &lt;br /&gt;
aglow, you touched me &lt;br /&gt;
with such unbearable &lt;br /&gt;
attention, accurate &lt;br /&gt;
fingers unlacing the slaughter, &lt;br /&gt;
numbers &amp;amp; the names of countries &lt;br /&gt;
crumbling in your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dear Sal,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For nearly a year I have been building a Word. &lt;br /&gt;
Hammering letters together, welding with a torch&lt;br /&gt;
that shoots a tongue-colored flame. I began&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
my work while remembering your pinky. How she &lt;br /&gt;
stands apart from all the others. They, a cluster &lt;br /&gt;
of gossips; she, preening, disturbing the sensibilities. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is almost finished, the Word. I would say it here &lt;br /&gt;
but the walls would come crashing down. I wish &lt;br /&gt;
to say it in your house. In your father, mother,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
brother &amp;amp; his twelve-gauge altar. Instead I holler &lt;br /&gt;
recipes at lizards, cry Kaddish over birds that dash&lt;br /&gt;
their brains out on the door. The Word is going &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
extinct in my mouth. Sing to me, Bashert, once &lt;br /&gt;
more. There is not enough room in the world &lt;br /&gt;
for your silence.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dear Sal,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Burning beds in a field I command the light, unleash it in the direction of your dress.&lt;br /&gt;
I repeat your name to a cavalry of stars, hold to their noses a section of your dress.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You found me trembling like a donkey at the altar, starving &amp;amp; skinny, my hair a ghost’s nest.&lt;br /&gt;
You took me inside to bind my wound in water, nourish me on the confection of your dress.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A basket of peaches underneath your arm, the orchards of silence uprooted in your chest,&lt;br /&gt;
you stroll through the blinding honeysuckle, its scent the only explanation for your dress.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A sycamore sags on the side of a road, bones of a forgotten saint, unsung &amp;amp; under-blessed.&lt;br /&gt;
May you be delivered up from her roots, may you bloom in the rich salvation of her dress.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How dark is the sum of the unburied dead? They scale the moonlight &amp;amp; bellow distress.&lt;br /&gt;
What relief awaits when you unfold the fabrics &amp;amp; open the organization of your dress.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Refugees cascade from the mouths whales, in a language of no they are the last remaining yes.&lt;br /&gt;
I came from the dark with a war in my teeth, seeking clemency here in the nation of your dress.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I die in in the tub as the coffee is brewing - I am lifted by the angels, I am lifted by regrets.&lt;br /&gt;
I am brought back to life in a room on the river, warning against the negation of your dress.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dear Sal,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After all these years I’ve reached my age. To celebrate I eat a tuna salad on rye&lt;br /&gt;
the size of a Buick. There is the mishegas &amp;amp; there is the mishegas. The man who&lt;br /&gt;
gave me a voice, he didn’t even speak the language. Oy, what a shondeh. Do you &lt;br /&gt;
know what the word Bashert means? It means I would go back to Europe for you. &lt;br /&gt;
I would eat mayonnaise on the Eiffel Tower. I would surround a tree with presents &lt;br /&gt;
for the phantoms of our children, sing to the Rhine in the language of my people. &lt;br /&gt;
If that, Bashert, is your wish. What have I been trying to say about desire? Stuffing &lt;br /&gt;
tuna salad sandwich into my mouth. It is not something I can afford. At this time &lt;br /&gt;
of day the park is almost empty. I want to hide in the grass &amp;amp; make animal sounds,&lt;br /&gt;
get the whole damn place to myself. Bashert, imagine! Just the two of us, strolling&lt;br /&gt;
hand in hand, the beast of longing whimpering under our shoes. We call it longing &lt;br /&gt;
because it takes forever. I am, years old. How can it matter? I hope somehow I have &lt;br /&gt;
made you laugh. What do you call the most Jewish fish? The anchoyvey. I made that&lt;br /&gt;
one up while the moon ate my legs. Ah yes, &amp;amp; the shadow is mine. My beard, heavy &lt;br /&gt;
with fish &amp;amp; salt &amp;amp; seeds. What do you call a garden on the bottom of the ocean? &lt;br /&gt;
Climb out of the wind if you know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Five Myths and Misfortunes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;i.&lt;br /&gt;
:: foliage&lt;br /&gt;
summer is long gone&lt;br /&gt;
winter is yet to come&lt;br /&gt;
let alone the spring but&lt;br /&gt;
let me come to think of it;&lt;br /&gt;
about the brown fall for&lt;br /&gt;
it can be a perfect lesson&lt;br /&gt;
about how death, of leaves&lt;br /&gt;
and living things, at the very&lt;br /&gt;
least, is beautiful and&lt;br /&gt;
ephemeral and beautiful and&lt;br /&gt;
ephemeral and be—&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
ii.&lt;br /&gt;
:: apollo&lt;br /&gt;
exploding tanks, wasted oxygen,&lt;br /&gt;
choked throats, dry lungs, almost lost&lt;br /&gt;
forever in foreign space and home;&lt;br /&gt;
but home was the last thing we recalled&lt;br /&gt;
because the suits that allowed us to walk&lt;br /&gt;
inside this zero gravity cubicle&lt;br /&gt;
needed to call a small station in that&lt;br /&gt;
rotting blue planet, first of all&lt;br /&gt;
we were almost forever lost&lt;br /&gt;
yet home was calling us home&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
iii.&lt;br /&gt;
:: postman&lt;br /&gt;
he gazes through the window&lt;br /&gt;
and mumbles about loneliness;&lt;br /&gt;
of himself, stamp and airmail,&lt;br /&gt;
an old office he will someday leave&lt;br /&gt;
for retirement but then he checks his&lt;br /&gt;
phone and giggles and stops mumbling&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
iv.&lt;br /&gt;
:: astral&lt;br /&gt;
look at the girl in sweater&lt;br /&gt;
and brunette milk braids&lt;br /&gt;
crying while knotting the&lt;br /&gt;
dead dots beyond the skies&lt;br /&gt;
we can hear you, little girl&lt;br /&gt;
don’t hope for silly things like&lt;br /&gt;
getting new band merch for&lt;br /&gt;
christmas or losing weight&lt;br /&gt;
to the constellations because&lt;br /&gt;
even when we have lived here&lt;br /&gt;
for million years, we are still&lt;br /&gt;
unseen, our hopes are crashing&lt;br /&gt;
and burned like one of those dead&lt;br /&gt;
dots, again, but we are also one of&lt;br /&gt;
the dead dots, again, just in the&lt;br /&gt;
other side of galaxy you don’t see&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
v.&lt;br /&gt;
:: feast&lt;br /&gt;
my name is toothpick&lt;br /&gt;
but nobody picks me before&lt;br /&gt;
dinner or in the middle of dinner&lt;br /&gt;
or after dinner; whenever&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>4 Poems</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purge #1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The rain wrote &lt;br /&gt;
rhythms on your&lt;br /&gt;
bathroom window,&lt;br /&gt;
begged, let&lt;br /&gt;
me in, but&lt;br /&gt;
it could never&lt;br /&gt;
cleanse you&lt;br /&gt;
like the sound&lt;br /&gt;
of the toilet&lt;br /&gt;
flushing&lt;br /&gt;
your 550 calorie&lt;br /&gt;
dinner.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Purge #2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Your neck nearly snapped&lt;br /&gt;
when you whipped your head back&lt;br /&gt;
toward me, fingers&lt;br /&gt;
still pressed&lt;br /&gt;
against the toilet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Crumb&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If I eat less they’ll love me If I eat less they’ll think I’m beautiful If I eat less they’ll stop staring at my plate My stomach My sausage-link fingers And maple syrup-sweat stained armpits Stop staring at me like split-pea soup spills out of my mouth each and every time I try to talk Expecting me to cry and cry and cry and cry and cry and thank them as they tell me they’re worried about me Eating my food Their food Everybody’s God damn food If I eat less they’ll love me If I eat less they’ll think I’m beautiful If I eat less they’ll win then I’ll look like them I don’t want to look like them I want to look like me If I eat less they’ll flick flick flick me off the table I’ll eat less until I’m nothing but a crumb&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ukulele&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Luke gave me his mom’s Newports.&lt;br /&gt;
She hid them in the bathroom, buried&lt;br /&gt; 
beneath body towels because&lt;br /&gt;
she lied—told her family she quit&lt;br /&gt;
after surviving Breast Cancer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I took them to school with me,&lt;br /&gt;
zipped up in the front pocket&lt;br /&gt;
of my backpack.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I sold them to the alley kids&lt;br /&gt;
for a dollar a smoke because&lt;br /&gt;
they needed something&lt;br /&gt;
to look forward to, and&lt;br /&gt;
I needed money&lt;br /&gt;
to buy a ukulele.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
