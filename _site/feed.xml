        <title>Avian Autopsies and Other Romantic Dreams</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I see the crow split open&lt;br /&gt;
when I should be watching the ocean,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a stain between frothing white lace&lt;br /&gt;
and shell-bedded skin. I can’t stop thinking&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;about the utter wrongness of its body—&lt;br /&gt;
talons curved inward yet still poised&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for slaughter, the red wanting&lt;br /&gt;
where a beak should be, eyes and mouth lost&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to another creature’s hunger. I wonder if it drowned,&lt;br /&gt;
those tarred wings wilting first, or if its neck&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;had given way like ribbon. I’m not sure&lt;br /&gt;
which one I prefer. Either way,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;there’s carnage. I think I’m in love &lt;br /&gt;
right now and all I want is beaches&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;full of dead birds. A flood of limbs &lt;br /&gt;
washing up onshore. Seascapes sparkling&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;bright with bone.  I know this longing well—&lt;br /&gt;
the same way a knife only knows&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the yielding purr of softness&lt;br /&gt;
as the world curls around it,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;how a shark only knows&lt;br /&gt;
bloodshed &amp;amp; swimming. This is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;how bad it is: I need &lt;br /&gt;
someone else’s mouthful&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;of glossed teeth, or at least&lt;br /&gt;
something sharp in my throat. I deserve&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a proper maiming. I hope I never&lt;br /&gt;
get used to the wound.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hansel, From Home: An Apology (After Marie Howe’s Gretel From a Sudden Clearing)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There is no way to say it. Your window is collecting webs,&lt;br /&gt;
your blackberries ripen and swell and fall&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for the squirrels. Every day we spend less&lt;br /&gt;
and less time waiting. Sometimes I stand on the roof&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and say it into the wind: the first syllable&lt;br /&gt;
rises and drops to the ground, and the second&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;gets lost in the forest between my mind and my mouth,&lt;br /&gt;
to be picked apart by crows, who fly away&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;crying &lt;i&gt;rry, rry, rry.&lt;/i&gt; I don’t know how I got here.&lt;br /&gt;
How I made it here without you. All I did&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;was look back when you kept looking on,&lt;br /&gt;
stumble through the dark in some&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;backwards way, kicking mushrooms, breadcrumbs,&lt;br /&gt;
tripping over logs and nests, reaching&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;into your absence and finding suddenly&lt;br /&gt;
a recognizable tree, and mother, out front, looking for stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I called for you, I swear. So did she.&lt;br /&gt;
I try to say it in the morning, sitting on your bed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but the first syllable gets caught in the webs&lt;br /&gt;
of your open window, and when the spider comes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;she wraps it up, pauses, whispers &lt;i&gt;so?&lt;/i&gt;, and eats.&lt;br /&gt;
Every day something of yours disappears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The yellow dress, the small bird painting, and&lt;br /&gt;
one by one the books. I move through our house&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;trying to say it. &lt;i&gt;I am so&lt;/i&gt;, the clock has become&lt;br /&gt;
bored by my eyes. &lt;i&gt;I am so&lt;/i&gt;, I sleep terribly. &lt;i&gt;I am so&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Don&#39;t Hurt Yourself</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I bought pepper spray yesterday cause it was $10&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;amp; bedazzled. It’s still in the box on the kitchen&lt;br /&gt;
table. When I met Adam I was wearing a&lt;br /&gt;
halo cause it was Halloween. I gave it to him cause&lt;br /&gt;
he was turning 22 at midnight and also&lt;br /&gt;
probably I fell in love or maybe out of the sky&lt;br /&gt;
or both. We had so many sleepovers. We ordered&lt;br /&gt;
so much Chinese food. We were so sad about&lt;br /&gt;
money. Kelsey was followed home twice &amp;amp;&lt;br /&gt;
that was when I liked her so I was really empathetic.&lt;br /&gt;
She has a knife with a cat on it even though&lt;br /&gt;
she’s more of a dog person.  I have bedazzled&lt;br /&gt;
pepper spray recommended by Cosmo&lt;br /&gt;
in a plastic box on my kitchen table even though&lt;br /&gt;
I’m more of a person who’s scared all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;how long until the bad spot can be touched? I am asking for&lt;br /&gt;
myself. here, there are so many bruises in the making. I stand&lt;br /&gt;
up inside the orchard—little seedlings gather, apple cores, my&lt;br /&gt;
vertebrae stuck together, like so. is it ok if I crush you? I so&lt;br /&gt;
want to, I so love this dripping all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Cheese Toast</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;S01E01&lt;br /&gt;
“Everyone loves cheese toast,” said the TV judge. The contestant was safe, again. Not on top. She seethed with anger at cheddar and bread.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
S01E02&lt;br /&gt;
“Everyone loves cheese toast,” said the judge on the reality TV show. The chef beamed. It was made with spray cheese and garlic crostini.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
S01E03&lt;br /&gt;
“Everyone loves cheese toast,” said the main judge from the reality show. “But what you’ve done here grating 5 cheeses was amazing. A win.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
S01E04&lt;br /&gt;
“Everyone loves cheese toast,” said the reality show judge, “Have you had a glass of water? Go grab one!” The water board paid her 100K.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
S01E05&lt;br /&gt;
“Everyone loves cheese toast,” said the TV show judge, “But we’re tired of seeing it from you. Please pack your pots and pans, and go home.”&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Chrysalis</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Coming home from electrolysis&lt;br /&gt;
we think about the things&lt;br /&gt;
we wish someone had told us&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back when we still had time —&lt;br /&gt;
like, “if you want to be&lt;br /&gt;
a monster, you can just&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slice open your skin and step &lt;br /&gt;
out into the welcoming shadows&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the woods by the side of the road&lt;br /&gt;
— hunt birds, drink insect blood&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And grow scales, and faces&lt;br /&gt;
to lure boys to their death&lt;br /&gt;
when they drive by &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaning out the window&lt;br /&gt;
screaming things&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>100 years of ineptitude</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Walking around like some dude with nothing to do, unaware of the current inner workings of my own mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
All the people around don’t know anything, they’re so dumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Parachuting molly in Washington Sq. Park, I tell Audrey that I like stupid people, I just wish they were a little smarter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
“That’s the thing about the moon,” Audrey says, “if I wanted to, nothing could stop me from going there.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I look up and mumble, “Jesus,” under my breath, “it’s like blankets,” I say, “the atmosphere, sky, it’s fucking blankets.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Feeling not high enough, me and Audrey go back home to insufflate more MDMA where she asks about my first memory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
“A picnic,” I say, “with my mom and someone else, I don’t remember.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
“Stupid,” she says. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I display a disconcerted facial expression.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
“Stupid memories,” she says to herself, “they don’t mean anything to anyone.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
On our way to the reading, I’m thinking about puddles and other bodies of water when a man punches me in the back of the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
“Excuse me,” I say before laughing and walking away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
“Where do you think you’re going, motherfucker?” He says, “I’ll get you in your sleep!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
“Fuck off, Jerk-ass!” Audrey yells as the whole future feels like it’s opening up right in front of me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
“That was cool,” I observe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
“It was cool and kind of funny,” Audrey responds in the immediate aftermath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We finally make it to the reading where Sarah pleads with me, “Theo, stop patting my back when we hug, just hug me for real!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We’re all conversing within a group when Rachel jokingly says, “Where did my parents go wrong?”
“That’s a good tweet,” I say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
“That is a good tweet!” she rehashes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
After a mercifully short list of readers, me and Audrey go to the roof to smoke weed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
“It’s beautiful up here.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
“Roofs don’t really do anything for me,” she says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
“In the summertime, I’ll go on my roof everyday.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
“I’m not saying they’re bad, they’re just nothing special. I guess I enjoy the perspective, but-“&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
“I wasn’t trying to argue,” I say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
“It feels like you are.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Waiting in line for the bathroom, Henry notes that not only are the current occupants probably doing drugs, but we also plan to do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
“It’s always so nice seeing you,” I tell him after sharing a laugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
“I love you, Theo,” he says, his eyes becoming dull, “in confusing ways.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
“Thats,” I pause, “good to know.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Showing off to Audrey, I hop down the last three steps of the stoop and shout, “I give tonight a 7/10!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Discussing the recent meaningful interactions on our way home, I think about how how this time last year I was in San Francisco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The hills toppled around like sedated seagulls, there was a lot of yellow and pink, even nicer things probably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It’s weird how I always feel like the same person until I think about stuff for a little while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
“You never pay any attention to me,” Audrey says as it starts to rain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I sincerely apologize to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
“Rain, rain,” she says a few times until her voice quiets to a low murmur, “this is a secret to everyone asleep.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The next day, I wake up and it feels distinctly like a fade-in, or maybe a very long dissolve, through waking, pooping, showering whilst singing, dressing too long, coffee-ing, smoking, eating, smoking, talking too loudly, whispering unnecessarily, wondering hopefully, sleeping maybe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Ugh, I don’t want to get out of bed, there’s nothing to do and it’s all so hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
My roommate’s cats tip a glass off the coffee table and look me in the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
“Bastards,” I whisper dramatically and laugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I visualize laughter as something akin to magnetic waves that intensifies in proximity to domesticated animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
“Holy shit,” I realize, “I can apply meaning to anything.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I stare out the window at a spot on the neighboring building, a group of bricks midway between two third floor windows, and think to myself, “This must be it, this must be meaning.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>3 Poems</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;INTRODUCTION...&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;br /&gt;
Sestina (Altaforte), vis. the unwritten poem. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not expect to see&lt;br /&gt;
a skeleton green&lt;br /&gt;
behind the ash-fall&lt;br /&gt;
of colours&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sestina (Altaforte), vis. the unwritten poem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introduction.&lt;br /&gt;
INTRODUCTION&lt;br /&gt;
        Early one morning, words were &lt;br /&gt;
        Subsiding transport had&lt;br /&gt;
        May God forgive&lt;br /&gt;
        Or, as we said,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thebes is slow &lt;br /&gt;
goings on&lt;br /&gt;
to eyes to lids&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introduction.&lt;br /&gt;
INTRODUCTION&lt;br /&gt;
Sestina (Altaforte)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved the day&lt;br /&gt;
that ruined itself&lt;br /&gt;
upon the wind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Beech&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have not recently lost any items. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have not recently won any items. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are bidding on a cool&lt;br /&gt;
vintage funky retro fashion tea&lt;br /&gt;

trinket oak/beech jewellery hand-&lt;br /&gt;
made present, 100% excellent!&lt;br /&gt;
medium-sized wooden gift&lt;br /&gt;
box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cool young poets talking about their art basically Xxxx (excerpt)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I – INPUT: / OUTPUT:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my many young and beautiful friends &lt;br /&gt;
who used to be lovers:&lt;br /&gt;
and the rest: who work &lt;br /&gt;
now work to pieces of people&lt;br /&gt; 
at computers: to all &lt;br /&gt;
creatives: never the lesser ended&lt;br /&gt;
great use for these eight fingers,&lt;br /&gt;
to fear the momentum &lt;br /&gt;
of stack-handles, to feet on the slight &lt;br /&gt;
of the roll-along floor, the&lt;br /&gt;
skin-pocked carpets of our future&lt;br /&gt;
barred to the door, to make love, &lt;br /&gt;
I reckon&lt;br /&gt;
in pixels, only&lt;br /&gt;
only to each other,&lt;br /&gt;
in the basement of a library.&lt;br /&gt;
Against the days-numbered decimals&lt;br /&gt;
of Aristotle:&lt;br /&gt;
ΠΕΡΙ ΑΙΣΘΗΣΕΩΣ ΚΑΙ ΑΙΣΘΗΤΩΝ.&lt;br /&gt;
(trans.) I feel young, benumbed and taut together.&lt;br /&gt;
Those unwarranted, unexplained &lt;br /&gt;
capital letters.&lt;br /&gt;
Poems as rigid, too, as rigid as those letters,&lt;br /&gt;
the lifelike mnemonic of time&lt;br /&gt;
blending two past lovers,&lt;br /&gt;
my mind estranged by the law&lt;br /&gt;
that water is the thinnest of all the liquids&lt;br /&gt;
more difficult than oil even&lt;br /&gt;
to cup in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
