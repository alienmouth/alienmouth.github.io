        <title>Manchester Street</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I almost miss the cacophony  &lt;br /&gt;
of Brash Crashing syllables &lt;br /&gt;
that New England &lt;br /&gt;
way of sounding &lt;br /&gt;
off on the street  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;that porch on Manchester &lt;br /&gt;
Street, that apartment &lt;br /&gt;
with carbon dioxide sneaking in &lt;br /&gt;
with the heat, &lt;br /&gt;
filling rooms in a drowsy fog  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the street lights buzzing clementines &lt;br /&gt;
above the neighbor who has fallen &lt;br /&gt;
drunkenly in the street &lt;br /&gt;
and a band &lt;br /&gt;
of angry rescuers&lt;br /&gt;
Yell and drag at him  &lt;br /&gt;
in the confusion   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;half a dream, I was resigned to  &lt;br /&gt;
the mess of it all &lt;br /&gt;
A dash of freckled sun &lt;br /&gt;
that was you in the winter  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By spring the sky unfolded&lt;br /&gt;
and I was gone&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>eddie goode-shaman learns about death</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i remember anne&lt;br /&gt;
mostly as a voice&lt;br /&gt;
on the phone or &lt;br /&gt;
a body curled over&lt;br /&gt;
the kitchen counter&lt;br /&gt;
crying at the end&lt;br /&gt;
of something i was&lt;br /&gt;
too young to understand&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it turns out she died&lt;br /&gt;
4 years ago&lt;br /&gt;
somewhere in nevada&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i didnít even know &lt;br /&gt;
she’d moved&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;poets and outlaws as &lt;br /&gt;
sparkling fuses between&lt;br /&gt;
the beating of wings&lt;br /&gt;
and the blinking of&lt;br /&gt;
buzzards in a desert&lt;br /&gt;
no oneís bothered to name&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and later, pieces of harold&lt;br /&gt;
lloydís hand in the&lt;br /&gt;
prop bucket&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and youíll never have to work again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;eddie finds a few &lt;br /&gt;
factoids and lorca’s &lt;br /&gt;
left eye on the&lt;br /&gt;
clearance rack in&lt;br /&gt;
the curiosity shop&lt;br /&gt;
of the human heart&lt;br /&gt;
they pay for themselves&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and he walks out into&lt;br /&gt;
the world w/ a new found&lt;br /&gt;
faith in the christian work &lt;br /&gt;
ethic and lorca’s left &lt;br /&gt;
eye in his back pocket&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the squealing of tires&lt;br /&gt;
and monday morning hung-over&lt;br /&gt;
moaning of would be&lt;br /&gt;
olympians manages to&lt;br /&gt;
keep the birds away&lt;br /&gt;
in a city where all&lt;br /&gt;
the signs read&lt;br /&gt;
fuck you        pay me&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Slowly</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Let us take all the long time we need&lt;br /&gt;
To wake up from our overdue dreams&lt;br /&gt;
Get out of the bed, and stretch our&lt;br /&gt;
Limbs as far as possible for a new morning&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us take all the long time we need&lt;br /&gt;
To listen to the first song of the birds&lt;br /&gt;
Watch the rise of this summer sun, feel&lt;br /&gt;
The breeze combing each tree with tenderness&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us take all the long time we need&lt;br /&gt;
To enjoy being together with our beloved&lt;br /&gt;
Exchange a smile so that they can stay with&lt;br /&gt;
Us just a few seconds or even minutes longer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, let’s take all the long time we need&lt;br /&gt;
To drink this tea, to chat about this weather&lt;br /&gt;
To look back at the road we have travelled along&lt;br /&gt;
To think, to cry, and to die in lingering twilight&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>some may call it a goat farm but i called it march beside you</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;i love you more than that train car &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;amp; the things you made me feel in it &lt;br /&gt;
made me feel like the train car&lt;br /&gt;
(stained by clay/spring heat)&lt;br /&gt;
(filled with abandoned wasps’&lt;br /&gt;
nests you filled with cigarette&lt;br /&gt;
breath til it dripped out like &lt;br /&gt;
spit down your pretty mouth)&lt;br /&gt;
(like some day a couple o’&lt;br /&gt;
kids might just fall in love &lt;br /&gt;
within my red rotting wood,&lt;br /&gt;
their hands not touching but&lt;br /&gt;
held somehow–i remember&lt;br /&gt;
something in a science class&lt;br /&gt;
about how we’re all always&lt;br /&gt;
touching if you think about&lt;br /&gt;
the body as a magnet &amp;amp; &lt;br /&gt;
since i’ve met you i’ve been&lt;br /&gt;
thinking about my body as&lt;br /&gt;
one of those little wooden&lt;br /&gt;
train cars with the magnets &lt;br /&gt;
on either end &amp;amp; you as a &lt;br /&gt;
train car with a magnet on &lt;br /&gt;
both ends &amp;amp; my heart’s a &lt;br /&gt;
little kid with hands that &lt;br /&gt;
keep pushing us together &lt;br /&gt;
somewhere behind or &lt;br /&gt;
beyond the tracks, beyond&lt;br /&gt;
the smoke)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Happy Birthday Baby</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote that, I wrote the baby part and I don’t know why&lt;br /&gt;
It felt kind of butch, it felt like putting all my fingers in&lt;br /&gt;
your mouth, it felt like penetration&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you can skim-read me, don’t worry&lt;br /&gt;
I say I love you like it’s water, like I&lt;br /&gt;
would die in three days without&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Paradise</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;line-bigger&quot;&gt;
	I say &lt;i&gt;aspen&lt;/i&gt; meaning &lt;i&gt;elm&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;br /&gt;
	speak of the cottonwood. &lt;br /&gt;
	The boy was not in love with &lt;br /&gt;
	trains as the other boys were, &lt;br /&gt;
	and ran from their distant &lt;br /&gt;
	noise in terror, ran until a &lt;br /&gt;
	parent scooped him up and &lt;br /&gt;
	hugged him near. &lt;i&gt;Harmless&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;i&gt;time&lt;/i&gt;, she whispers. Red is not, &lt;br /&gt;
	however, obviously endless. I &lt;br /&gt;
	watched three men grill three &lt;br /&gt;
	rows of sausages each on &lt;br /&gt;
	three grills facing the beach.&lt;br /&gt; 
	That was the morning after &lt;br /&gt;
	the earthquake article, and &lt;br /&gt;
	we all felt somewhat older. &lt;br /&gt;
	Uncommon seeing. A habit &lt;br /&gt;
	imbues what is hope with &lt;br /&gt;
	actual practice.
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>What I Talk About When I Don&#39;t Want to Talk About Katrina</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Having a cat, used to talking&lt;br /&gt;
to myself, there is a limit&lt;br /&gt;
on how much catastrophe&lt;br /&gt;
we can handle. 34 left&lt;br /&gt;
at the nursing home to die&lt;br /&gt;
fell on the bad side.&lt;br /&gt;
Since when are we satisfied&lt;br /&gt;
with a slow gouge without&lt;br /&gt;
resolution and revelation&lt;br /&gt;
of the emotion at play?&lt;br /&gt;
There was a time when she&lt;br /&gt;
cranked up the category, as if&lt;br /&gt;
to say, Hey this is what a body&lt;br /&gt;
looks like turned inside out!&lt;br /&gt;
(I am talking to myself again)&lt;br /&gt;
I reconcile that slush-thrower&lt;br /&gt;
peeling back the city’s onion-&lt;br /&gt;
strata with no space for grave-&lt;br /&gt;
yards to stack bodies in layers.&lt;br /&gt;
I’ve made sandwiches before,&lt;br /&gt;
all the while talking to my cat,&lt;br /&gt;
waiting for its backtalk.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>a selfie of my spaciousness</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I tried on a dress &lt;br /&gt;
at Zara.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a selfie of my&lt;br /&gt;
spaciousness&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;inside&lt;br /&gt;
Of It.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t buy it.&lt;br /&gt;
Even though I wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I &lt;br /&gt;
had the Power to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but I wanted to&lt;br /&gt;
Buy It.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Rage, rage&lt;br /&gt;
against your&lt;br /&gt;
inner capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rage, rage &lt;br /&gt;
deep in the fist&lt;br /&gt;
of your Softness.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Spotify is trying to get me&lt;br /&gt;
to listen to my ex’s music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I’m all like&lt;br /&gt;
‘Only&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if the songs are all about &lt;br /&gt;
how amazing I am’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But really I’m just like ‘nah’.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t listen.&lt;br /&gt;
even though I want to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I&lt;br /&gt;
have the power to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I do want to&lt;br /&gt;
Hear.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I feel Real&lt;br /&gt;
waiting for the metro&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;with other real people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you do it?&lt;br /&gt;
I think at them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How are you so good&lt;br /&gt;
at being a human?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Loft&lt;br /&gt;
people are doing stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Casually asking for money&lt;br /&gt;
without having done anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel real&lt;br /&gt;
but imaginary as well&lt;br /&gt;
somehow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel shy about&lt;br /&gt;
reciprocating this Feeling&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t let out&lt;br /&gt;
Yet.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>4 Poems</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME I HAVE 635 FRIENDS ON FACEBOOK&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&#39;m tired of &lt;br /&gt;
falling in &amp;amp; out&lt;br /&gt;
of love with people&lt;br /&gt;
every single night&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;there are only so many ways&lt;br /&gt;
to show what side of the lake you&#39;re on&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;I&#39;D RATHER BE BEAUTIFUL THAN MALE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The moon is trans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

From this moment forward, the moon is trans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

You don’t get to write about the moon anymore unless you respect that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

You don’t get to talk to the moon anymore unless you use her correct pronouns.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;- joshua jennifer espinoza&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;amp; when the big dumb moon fell into our bed&lt;br /&gt;
i was right in the middle of telling you&lt;br /&gt;
about how i would like to coach your favorite baseball team&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;amp; after she fell into our bed&lt;br /&gt;
the moon asked about phases&lt;br /&gt;
why hers were called phases&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;amp; how scary that word is&lt;br /&gt;
you told her &lt;i&gt;the sky&lt;br /&gt;
changes colors &lt;br /&gt;
turning blue &amp;amp; purple&lt;br /&gt;
like the body&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
she understood&lt;br /&gt;
kind of&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;amp; i told her &lt;br /&gt;
she&#39;s not ready for everything&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;that&#39;s okay&lt;br /&gt;
we&#39;re all okay&lt;br /&gt;
your light hits all of us&lt;br /&gt;
so we are all you&lt;br /&gt;
a small part of each of us&lt;br /&gt;
is the moon&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;amp; she&#39;s beautiful&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
i said &lt;i&gt;we are all the moon&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;amp; we are all butterflies &lt;br /&gt;
who think living for a day&lt;br /&gt;
is living for a lifetime&lt;br /&gt;
even though some of us&lt;br /&gt;
can&#39;t keep going &lt;br /&gt;
especially after seeing our naked bodies&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;amp; the first time i looked&lt;br /&gt;
into the mirror after cutting my hair&lt;br /&gt;
i was finally beautiful&lt;br /&gt;
just kidding &lt;br /&gt;
i have always been beautiful&lt;br /&gt;
the moon swore she heard someone crying &lt;br /&gt;
outside of our window&lt;br /&gt;
we ignored it&lt;br /&gt;
she said &lt;i&gt;i think we should really check on them&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;amp; i said &lt;i&gt;we&#39;re always feeling glaciers moving &lt;br /&gt;
at the bottom of our stomachs&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
i said this to no one in particular &lt;br /&gt;
so then the moon asked me&lt;br /&gt;
when i started wearing glasses&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;amp; at this point &lt;br /&gt;
you had gotten out of bed &lt;br /&gt;
to get some water&lt;br /&gt;
so you didn&#39;t hear this part&lt;br /&gt;
but i said&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;i can remember when my dad started wearing glasses&lt;br /&gt;
but not my mom&lt;br /&gt;
my mom can&#39;t really see me anymore&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;amp; then the room filled up with air &lt;br /&gt;
the kind that fills up rooms&lt;br /&gt;
before it rains&lt;br /&gt;
the moon asked me &lt;br /&gt;
if i ever experienced &lt;br /&gt;
a major death in my family &amp;amp; i said &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;no&lt;br /&gt;
can we go back to talking about how beautiful you are&lt;br /&gt;
can we go back to talking about all the love poems &lt;br /&gt;
i tried to write for each bridge i&#39;ve walked over but never did&lt;br /&gt;
can you watch me foam at the mouth with every cloud &lt;br /&gt;
that ever existed&lt;br /&gt;
but slowly disappeared&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;amp; then you came back into the room&lt;br /&gt;
but it was too dark so i didn&#39;t notice &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;amp; continued to tell the moon about the time my astronomy professor &lt;br /&gt;
told my class that we were never supposed to be here&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;amp; how us being here&lt;br /&gt;
alive on earth &lt;br /&gt;
is the same probability of winning the lottery 100,000 times&lt;br /&gt;
how fucked up is that?&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;amp; then i had to leave the room because i needed to cry in the rain&lt;br /&gt;
so i&#39;m not sure what you &amp;amp; the moon talked about which is fine i guess&lt;br /&gt;
i just want to know&lt;br /&gt;
will you please stop leaving all the photographs in the fridge?&lt;br /&gt;
pressing the buttons on a camera makes strawberries&lt;br /&gt;
according to a four year old&lt;br /&gt;
who is taking pictures of beautiful things&lt;br /&gt;
with a camera that doesn&#39;t work&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;amp; before the moon left&lt;br /&gt;
she made everything quiet for us&lt;br /&gt;
so we could hear the universe&#39;s slow hum&lt;br /&gt;
i could imagine the weather &lt;br /&gt;
on the day every person i know was born&lt;br /&gt;
the first day of K&#39;s life was probably the only day in october &lt;br /&gt;
that held rain&lt;br /&gt;
because she&#39;s always crying&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;amp; i&#39;m always feeling reflections of rainbows when she laughs&lt;br /&gt;
i told the moon this &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;amp; she said &lt;i&gt;thank you&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;amp; turned me into stardust while you were pulling out &lt;br /&gt;
your eyelashes unintentionally&lt;br /&gt;
she climbed back into the sky&lt;br /&gt;
with a sign the read&lt;br /&gt;
the inverse of you&lt;br /&gt;
is the universe &lt;br /&gt;
i know that&#39;s not always enough&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;please stop being beautiful in front of me because it is very hard to live when you are right next to a person, a beautiful one, like yourself. Mercury is spinning around us &amp;amp; there are currently no plans but soon I will end up saying something like Maybe we should just elope &amp;amp; you will say But my family needs to be there &amp;amp; I will say We should buy a farm so your family can come visit us on it. you will ask What about your family &amp;amp; I will open the window then ask Where are all the fucking seagulls? sometimes October rings inside my ears. sometimes I want to tell you I think it&#39;s time to start living like a tree before we turn into tables. you will give me a look like the look I give any child under two who can&#39;t tie their shoes &amp;amp; I will say Don&#39;t worry, I promise to be better just after I press my hand into some wet soil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;here is a love letter to my body / thank you for fixing me up when I fall on a hard sidewalk &amp;amp; also fuck you for making me cry in every single bathroom / this is starting to get beautiful / &amp;amp; fuck anyone who thinks saying the word beautiful in a poem is wrong / this is a poem for the beautiful people who have felt like they were wrong / for everyone who still has caterpillar skin watching butterflies laugh around them / butterflies so light they can land on a person&#39;s nose / yeah /  a nose / for everyone waiting patiently to be able to fly / clothes aren&#39;t gendered so why don&#39;t you go fuck yourself / i&#39;m waiting for different colors to turn into me&lt;/p&gt;
