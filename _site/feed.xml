        <description>&lt;p&gt;there’s a dead bird dead&lt;br /&gt;
on crystals with thorns&lt;br /&gt;
like piss&lt;br /&gt;
i’m going to cvs for&lt;br /&gt;
heavy public toilets&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sad debris is my vampire&lt;br /&gt;
under day sun&lt;br /&gt;
let’s use the puppy dog&lt;br /&gt;
filter as i perform breathing&lt;br /&gt;
faces through bird beaks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i say we need fat cheeseburgers&lt;br /&gt;
you ignore my fat nails&lt;br /&gt;
i apologize and settle for dead&lt;br /&gt;
mouths i’m growing pains with you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i’m eating dead seaweed and&lt;br /&gt;
will save humanity&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;let me spit hair and thread&lt;br /&gt;
fake sperm in balloons&lt;br /&gt;
blow now &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;dead birds dying is a first&lt;br /&gt;
world hypocrisy i have&lt;br /&gt;
to pee in cvs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i know my rights as dead&lt;br /&gt;
cheeseburger my &lt;br /&gt;
fingers are wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;—- &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Better Homes and Gardens</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;i. Scene or Posture&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we are the bitches of Avenue X&lt;br /&gt;
most of us are dead anyways or drove home&lt;br /&gt;
there were Reward Miles involved&lt;br /&gt;
butted lines at concert, that kind of thing&lt;br /&gt;
weavers of failed delivery sexts, fishers of drive&lt;br /&gt;
c’mere and founder on the shoals kind of thing&lt;br /&gt;
a suspenseful clutch of talent, who knew? &lt;br /&gt;
mature would be ignore it&lt;br /&gt;
go home at noon like 4:50&lt;br /&gt;
sleep it off at the altar of the not totally unfortunate looking&lt;br /&gt;
any wad that gums it up &lt;br /&gt;
it’s yours for blowing, like&lt;br /&gt;
have you ever been punk?&lt;br /&gt;
it goes like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ii. Competitive Fictions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The closer they glom the more they&lt;br /&gt;
know about derailleurs and shit&lt;br /&gt;
you’d like to tuck them in &lt;br /&gt;
at home, plant &amp;amp; &lt;br /&gt;
add water till they grow willowy&lt;br /&gt;
mean &amp;amp; well-behaved, each &lt;br /&gt;
bowing to a blaze of mirrors like the Eve of an Eve&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;who can’t get hard or down, whose eyes&lt;br /&gt;
won’t bug. Was it grace waiting all night at a keyboard&lt;br /&gt;
for an unmentionable chord, was it kinder to be 40?&lt;br /&gt;
From her perch reciting: Homer calls it&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;atrugetoio&lt;/i&gt; the sea, unyielding&lt;br /&gt;
a barren downy bed, a nymph’s mucosal hug&lt;br /&gt;
Oh, baby girl. Your princess, etc. Find another row to hoe another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iii. les neiges de J/O, New Jersey&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wake up in the 90’s like you crashed &lt;br /&gt;
the walking tour of the decade’s tallest&lt;br /&gt;
girlfriends and their driveways&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;amp; broke up the band&lt;br /&gt;
the names are still kinda special &lt;br /&gt;
they’re all burnout&lt;br /&gt;
vegetarians or you get the idea&lt;br /&gt;
bam!&lt;br /&gt;
they’re hot and you’re naked &lt;br /&gt;
Everyone looks good here&lt;br /&gt;
you could be a +1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Peut être</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My boy wears grease that &lt;br /&gt;
smells like cinnamon in his hair.&lt;br /&gt;
It lingers on the pillows &lt;br /&gt;
and I don’t want to forget that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There aren’t any squash in the garden but&lt;br /&gt;
the blooms sure look pretty&lt;br /&gt;
like springtime tender&lt;br /&gt;
even in the eleventh month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When there is rose &lt;br /&gt;
lemonade at the market&lt;br /&gt;
and when there are curbsides &lt;br /&gt;
bathed in sunlight, &lt;br /&gt;
maybe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Parade Is Not Diplomacy</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s an egg in the dark&lt;br /&gt;
and somebody talking to you.&lt;br /&gt;
An egg in the dark and a man—&lt;br /&gt;
you—under the shut sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When somebody calls you all light up&lt;br /&gt;
and walk the shores in rows&lt;br /&gt;
like untrustworthy mushrooms.&lt;br /&gt;
You are more scattered than a row&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and devour the flank&lt;br /&gt;
after the battle. You take it down together&lt;br /&gt;
and peel back the flank&lt;br /&gt;
of the animal. Fur glued to paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paper glued to the backs of your hands.&lt;br /&gt;
“It’s like it nourishes me.”&lt;br /&gt;
You finally get to be sad like the moon,&lt;br /&gt;
together. Everybody is mad at each other!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t know them! You&lt;br /&gt;
know the sand. It’s thick,&lt;br /&gt;
like silt. Your characters exit,&lt;br /&gt;
presumably to have sex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You finally believe your luck&lt;br /&gt;
sitting across from a great actress, who says,&lt;br /&gt;
“Being with other people will ruin your life.&lt;br /&gt;
Always should, always has to, always will.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Some Spirits Have Been around Longer Than Other Spirits</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The universe is doing well. There are many planets. There are many planets we cannot see. Planets with names like MOA-2007-BLG-192Lb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Milky Way galaxy there are 100 to 400 billion planets. If you want to name a planet you can. Name it anything you want. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A person on Earth looks at a computer screen. The person is Larry Page. Larry Page has named two planets. Larry Page is looking at his computer screen thinking about eternity, non-existence, prostate cancer. Larry Page is going to die. In his next life, he hopes to be a Solitary Eagle, Harpyhaliaetus solitarius. He will live in South America, soar above the Peruvian rain forest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, a person in a two-bedroom house watches a movie and laughs. Another person hides under a blanket and reads. Between the visible stars are more stars. Between Larry Page and the tree is twenty feet. Between Larry Page’s mind and the world is his skin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i digged graves&lt;br /&gt;
subsisted on bones&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;crushed tomatos&lt;br /&gt;
to stain my lips red&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>SOMETIMES THERE ARE MEN</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I suck my teeth at you&lt;br /&gt;
and hear the clinking of keys&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a lemon in my mouth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to be forgiven&lt;br /&gt;
but now I am not&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;an edge&lt;br /&gt;
that rounded itself&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;there are windows everywhere I go&lt;br /&gt;
but I hardly ever count them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have never felt closer to god&lt;br /&gt;
than when I smile at a TV show&lt;br /&gt;
or maybe a child&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the best things&lt;br /&gt;
are when it is quiet&lt;br /&gt;
and I am alone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I already know what your mouth tastes like:&lt;br /&gt;
the forest floor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in short,&lt;br /&gt;
wet.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>city</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I.	city&lt;br /&gt;
Where lives are controlled thru threats &lt;br /&gt;
Drugs and violence. The audience&lt;br /&gt;
hold crosses. Its ignorance  holds &lt;br /&gt; 
Down the universe twisting  fingers. At night &lt;br /&gt;
My arms hold multi colored crystals. My black &lt;br /&gt;
Gloves like a symbol of God holds the addicts.&lt;br /&gt;
My friend’s think I’m a painter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;II.&lt;br /&gt;
My name is Sunday. I survived &lt;br /&gt;
Being a movie star. I felt  pain too much &lt;br /&gt;
To be embarrassed. I’ve been the unemployed &lt;br /&gt;
Friend. Quiet  dark and wrinkled. On  &lt;br /&gt;
My stomach to soften my hunger. Good bye &lt;br /&gt;
Not  the final word. If you believe that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;III.&lt;br /&gt;
And suddenly &lt;br /&gt;
Breaking into sunrise. I came crying.&lt;br /&gt;
I repeated all that happened. I was &lt;br /&gt;
In back seat when the car pulled over.&lt;br /&gt;
An explosive human stampede&lt;br /&gt;
Happening on my ribs and head&lt;br /&gt;
Police stripped me out two grams&lt;br /&gt;
And dragged along the empty street&lt;br /&gt;
My lips wet with blood, I thought,&lt;br /&gt;
This my murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IV&lt;br /&gt;
Dying is an ancient disgrace like painting &lt;br /&gt;
Poetry art literature. It’s dumb.  When I wake &lt;br /&gt;
Up. Tell me you will  reach. Tell me you will &lt;br /&gt;
Recognize. Tell me you will take&lt;br /&gt;
 me to bed instead of your husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;V.&lt;br /&gt;
The faint sound of sirens connects me&lt;br /&gt;
To this place. It’s a  place that reminds  us &lt;br /&gt;
Of Egypt. The children chew tobacco weed &lt;br /&gt;
Leaves &lt;br /&gt;
And marshmallows produce  a sap &lt;br /&gt;
Used to heal wounds.  Everyone watching&lt;br /&gt;
Everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>2 poems</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I Don’t Know How to Say This in Your Language&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rain is drift-falling and layers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;cannot save you from this winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the sidewalk, an African immigrant&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;leans against concrete, his Air&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jordans leathered and grounded&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in a shift of faces. I wonder&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if there is an art to dying&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;young—if Turkish food markets&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;remind us good times aren’t forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Castles have fallen here but some&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;still watchdog the Spree,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;pushing back against snow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we arrived to a&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;chestpunch of dark and cups of red&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;wine. We walked&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to the farside until we no longer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;knew ourselves, until they looked at us&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for our tongues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Millennial Walks into a Bar and Says:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start off with a Disney movie because why&lt;br /&gt;
shouldn’t we? The one where the boy gets sucked&lt;br /&gt;
into the game his father created. Virtual reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And let’s consider how there is an invisibility to&lt;br /&gt;
everything. The way voices can break airwaves across &lt;br /&gt;
oceans slapping against us. And let’s disregard&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the tsunami ripples. Who takes responsibility for this, anyways?&lt;br /&gt;
It’s an American thing to scream out take no prisoners in public. If not,&lt;br /&gt;
it should be. Think of national security threats. Anonymous hackers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;who break code. I asked my students what they thought&lt;br /&gt;
about this and they told me about plaid shirts, the lag&lt;br /&gt;
of internet, Wreckin’ Ralph. I’ve mentioned&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;another Disney movie I haven’t seen.&lt;br /&gt;
But I sometimes worry about oil pipelines in North Dakota.&lt;br /&gt;
About congress evil-scheming behind&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;us. They will plant lemon trees&lt;br /&gt;
in our backyards and it’ll be okay. This is approval &lt;br /&gt;
by majority so sit back and watch that shit grow. I apologize&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if nothing bothers you. I am easily bothered. This brings me&lt;br /&gt;
back to lemon trees and oil pipelines. Doesn’t this seem&lt;br /&gt;
like Planet of the Apes? What if Charlton Heston was telling us&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;something when he said “I’m sending my last signal&lt;br /&gt;
to Earth before we reach our destination.”&lt;br /&gt;
This is a rough paraphrase. What isn’t rough?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When they discovered neon it was accidental.&lt;br /&gt;
When they discovered continents it was accidental.&lt;br /&gt;
When they discovered race it was accidental.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe not. Maybe I’m saying history&lt;br /&gt;
isn’t orchestrated by a perfect God. &lt;br /&gt;
We are byproducts of earthquakes. And English&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;is commonly spoken everywhere. Does anyone&lt;br /&gt;
care that it started with rape?&lt;br /&gt;
Sometimes I speak in a voice that isn’t mine. Maybe &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it’s yours. I apologize. I apologize a lot. I apologize&lt;br /&gt;
for apologizing so much. In the 1940s&lt;br /&gt;
a group of teenage boys were used&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for experiments during the Holocaust. I learned about them&lt;br /&gt;
during our tour of a death camp in Oranienburg.&lt;br /&gt;
How the Germans kept them around for scientific purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How those boys outlived German lieutenants. Poetic justice&lt;br /&gt;
some might say. Meanwhile in the South Bronx teenagers&lt;br /&gt;
built cultures from wax, DJed inside broken&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;down project buildings and spit fluids into crowds&lt;br /&gt;
who kept their hands up until the break of dawn. A breaking&lt;br /&gt;
dance motion. Contortion of the spirit. Head spins. Nothing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;like U.S. military drones missing their targets. Nothing.&lt;br /&gt;
But everything like jazz quartets. In New Orleans&lt;br /&gt;
there are streets that have retained the noises of ghosts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tchoupitoulas; Calliope; St. Claude. Find me&lt;br /&gt;
there. I want to remix the wrongs and make a mixtape&lt;br /&gt;
of imperfections. Put it in your stereo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let your older brother get drunk to it. Let your grandmother&lt;br /&gt;
fall asleep to this. Dreams are the origin of an end.&lt;br /&gt;
Think about it. Flying cars and robots that act and look&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;fakingly real. Am I wrong for this? I really can’t say&lt;br /&gt;
I’m Mexican just as I really can’t say&lt;br /&gt;
I’m American. Someone built this bridge between me. They carved&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;hyphens from the air for me to cross. Not just the crossings&lt;br /&gt;
you might be thinking. But the sort that can birth multiples: &lt;br /&gt;
national borders, a puzzle, holy crucifixions, movements&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;across disparate bodies. I apologize again. I just did that thing&lt;br /&gt;
when you use a word in your definition to define another word.&lt;br /&gt;
I’m sure language is empired from mistakes so&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d rather not take this to you. It might stifle what my friend Stan&lt;br /&gt;
calls moon-guzzling. Instead, keep jogging until you reach&lt;br /&gt;
the edge of yourself. And jump off. And find pleasure between your falling breaths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The week before Obama’s presidency ended we drove&lt;br /&gt;
to Half Moon Bay. There was 80s synthpop and a flood&lt;br /&gt;
of trap wave playing. I found a decayed bunker on a cliffside:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;aqua graffiti letters spelled INNA TRIBE. Yesterday,&lt;br /&gt;
I ate ribs at a mom and pop’s in Hayward. The talk of teaching,&lt;br /&gt;
of weddings, the slow goodness of slow-cooked BBQ inside us. Nobody&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;flinches. Imagine Jeff Chang and Chinaka Hodge hurling poems&lt;br /&gt;
at the heads of protestors in our streets while something burns&lt;br /&gt;
in the near distance. Orange horizons to remind us of unbroken nights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember to drive slow and pump your brakes. An orchestra of Kanye.&lt;br /&gt;
Shakir from West Oakland singing Italian operas—California&lt;br /&gt;
house parties. Not like what you see in movies. Or maybe&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it is. We were born here and raised up like the Redwoods. Who asked?&lt;br /&gt;
Moving on, our neighbors are new and the old ones just moved out.&lt;br /&gt;
Not always by choice. How does space change over time? It’s just time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;they say. I don’t talk with my mom much because she bounces&lt;br /&gt;
around, this time to LA. Video games are her pleasure. In Dragon Age Inquisition&lt;br /&gt;
you play as a character who hunts dragons and has sex with others—&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;she explained this to me. I’ve never owned a PS4 though. In the magazine Wired&lt;br /&gt;
you can read about two sisters from Seattle, ages 9 and 11, who built a Do-It-Yourself&lt;br /&gt;
spacecraft out of simple materials, used a GoPro to capture its ascent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;into the blindness of space. It’s all on YouTube. I wonder&lt;br /&gt;
if our imaginations get wrinkled and weary like adults. I wonder&lt;br /&gt;
if things are really things. I’d bet that all things eventually change&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;because someone didn’t want them to. (i.e. Civil Rights). How this&lt;br /&gt;
can all pour from my fingers in a matter of minutes. Like newspapers&lt;br /&gt;
becoming outdated. We mostly use Facebook as a source of news, anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entertainment doesn’t hide itself from us very well. At the gym,&lt;br /&gt;
why do we look so discomfortable? At bars, why&lt;br /&gt;
do we look so discomfortable? This is rude of me to ask on a first date,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been told. Perhaps the salad would have been a better choice.&lt;br /&gt;
Locally foraged, says the 8-pt. font menu. Some of us would rather eat strawberries&lt;br /&gt;
at home while watching Trevor Noah. Note to self: do this on a Wednesday night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, they need this. Remember, you need this. Everyday&lt;br /&gt;
is a remembering of too many things. That’s why we keep calendars.&lt;br /&gt;
Maybe I’ll cancel our plans and see what tomorrow shapes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
