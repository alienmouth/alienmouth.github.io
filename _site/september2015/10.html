        <p><b>missed connection</b>&lt;/br&gt;</p>
<p align="justify">i was a pair of rain soaked headlights &amp; u were a rlly cool deer. u looked at me the same way i look at birds &amp; idk i kind of liked it. &amp; yr hooves. i was probs teary eyed but it was raining so u probs couldn’t tell. i was on my way back from this, like, thing, idk u wouldn’t have understood. i think i liked u bc u looked a lot like my mother. at the time all i could do was blink a lot &amp; u only blinked once &amp; maybe that was when we became the new growth. we grew only then but it was enough. u let it go but i don’t think i ever can.</p>
<p>&lt;/br&gt;
~   ~   ~   ~&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
<b>missed connection</b>&lt;/br&gt;</p>
<p align="justify">i was a silence bathed in fire &amp; u were one of those self help books. i almost burned u but u were gr8 at gymnastics bc of yr helicopter parents. after the immediate danger was gone u stepped closer 2 me &amp; i almost died tbh. we were nvr meant 2 b 2gether, but u knew &amp; i knew. we both knew abt different things, but this thing we both knew. we had a special secret.</p>
<p>&lt;/br&gt;
~   ~   ~   ~&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
<b>missed connection</b></p>
<p align="justify">i was a cloud covering the sun &amp; u were the sun &amp; u said “can u plz move so i can shine 2day?” &amp; i said “no i’m sorry i cannot. 2day. it is not the right day.” the sun asked “when is the right day?” &amp; i replied by saying nothing, which i thought was appropriate bc i never wanted 2 leave. bc i was boiling in front of u &amp; i fell in love w/ boiling as soon as i forgot 2 let go.
