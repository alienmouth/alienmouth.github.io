The barista at the shop with the most tolerable coffee <br />
 in town is like hi how are you? *wink* and I’m like idk<br />
 my sweater has a cupcake on it so good I guess  <br />
and he’s like it also has a cherry on top *wink wink*  <br />
Before turning on the grinder he says let me start her up  <br />
do you want room for cream or should I fill it all the way?  <br />
*WINKKK* and I really wish I jumped him <br />
dark roasted his beans into a perfect shot of burn &amp; choke  <br />
like can’t a girl order a small blonde blend in peace?  <br />
In case you were wondering the word for heaps  <br />
of headless women falling spread-legged from a man’s maw  <br />
is women. The word for keeping the knees of my mouth together  <br />
like a good little bitch is also women is also Maybelline Baby Lips  <br />
Moisturizing Lip Balm is also soft, pink, your steak cooked  <br />
how you like it, bikini line waxed with obedience.  <br />
Look up the word cunnilingus on thesaurus dot com  <br />
and you will find<br /><br />

<p><b>Today</b><br /><br />
i woke up &amp; the sky was like wooooow congratulations<br />
here’s a cloud that sort of looks like it’s spelling out <i>snoop dogg.</i><br />
today i dropped it like it was burning because it was. <br />
today i watched a child wail at the grocery store<br />
because he was too big to sit in the shopping cart<br />
&amp; i was like i know right? today i used a knife<br />
to slice the hunger it was intended for &amp; nothing else.<br />
today my bills are past due. today i have a mailbox <br />
for them to keep each other warm in. today you texted me <br />
&amp; i turned into the emoji with hearts for eyes. <br />
today my heart has eyes and they are open. <br />
today i turned down a street that shares my father’s name <br />
&amp; i’m sorry my heart had to see that. today <br />
is his birthday but the candles are already blown out. <br />
today i dumped salt into the bowl instead of sugar. <br />
today the doctor made a list of options &amp; none<br />
of them included time. today whiskey. today tequila, <br />
kahlúa, the nips in the trunk from new year’s eve. <br />
today greg got so drunk he ordered a bud light <br />
at the wendy's drive-thru. today we pulled forward <br />
to the next window. today i’m not sure <br />
what the weather forecast will be but there is one <br />
so it’s not all darkness. today [insert uplifting  quote<br /> 
by “unknown” here]. today the light turned yellow <br />
&amp; i slowed down. today you said my name &amp; i heard you. <br />
