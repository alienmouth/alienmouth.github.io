	<h1>Hansel, From Home: An Apology<br />
<i>(After Marie Howe’s Gretel From a Sudden Clearing)</i></h1>

<p>There is no way to say it. Your window is collecting webs,<br />
your blackberries ripen and swell and fall</p>

<p>for the squirrels. Every day we spend less<br />
and less time waiting. Sometimes I stand on the roof</p>

<p>and say it into the wind: the first syllable<br />
rises and drops to the ground, and the second</p>

<p>gets lost in the forest between my mind and my mouth,<br />
to be picked apart by crows, who fly away</p>

<p>crying <i>rry, rry, rry.</i> I don’t know how I got here.<br />
How I made it here without you. All I did</p>

<p>was look back when you kept looking on,<br />
stumble through the dark in some</p>

<p>backwards way, kicking mushrooms, breadcrumbs,<br />
tripping over logs and nests, reaching</p>

<p>into your absence and finding suddenly<br />
a recognizable tree, and mother, out front, looking for stars.</p>

<p>I called for you, I swear. So did she.<br />
I try to say it in the morning, sitting on your bed:</p>

<p>but the first syllable gets caught in the webs<br />
of your open window, and when the spider comes</p>

<p>she wraps it up, pauses, whispers <i>so?</i>, and eats.<br />
Every day something of yours disappears.</p>

<p>The yellow dress, the small bird painting, and<br />
one by one the books. I move through our house</p>

<p>trying to say it. <i>I am so</i>, the clock has become<br />
bored by my eyes. <i>I am so</i>, I sleep terribly. <i>I am so</i></p>
