<p>sitting by the pool watching light bounce prisms crystal water making steam like space like i’d want to and you said but you want it too much like you like it like me like you like me and i was like of course like you like me like what ever and i know you it’s cool like you like me you know it’s like any thing and the pool filter started spitting</p>

<p>Roses and mirrors kept following her. Roses at her feet, roses on the neighboring steps, roses next to garbage. The mirror in her dreams, before it she twirled, but every omen was hazy. A tired mouth opening and closing. A mouth fruitlessly spitting out grains of sand.<br /> <br />I feel like a little boat beaten about by the sea, she said. She said this to herself a lot.<br /> <br />Thoughtful and sad as one should be. She could not sleep. It was a dreadful thing to love a shadow. She covered herself and wandered. Steeled from people asking questions.<br /> <br />She looked out at the road at the line where the sun passes that she was always heading toward and didn't know why. Careful of each step.<br /> <br />Then a stranger appeared down the road. Looking like an old tree all overgrown with moss decked with oak­-leaves.<br /> <br />The stranger stood and watched from a distance. He recognized her gait. The stranger had heard things. The stranger wanted to know for sure. He rushed at her and whispered in her ear. She withdrew and they fought. He fell.<br /> <br />Rise or I shall kill you, she said.<br /> <br />Grass trampled stained with blood. They smote and thrust and smote again. He gathered strength and struck a terrific blow. To kill her quite but it sheared the front of her helmet. Her face uncovered.<br /> <br />Her arm dropped. The sword fell from her hand. She tried to speak roughly to him. Her tongue would not say the words.<br /> <br />Hot and pink. And her hair. So long reached her feet. Burst from its band. Her face strewn like a golden frame.<br /> <br />They stayed. They were still.<br /> <br />They rested and their wounds healed until at last he could stay no longer silent.

<p>I’d die to walk into a bathroom, do my thing, wash my hands and look up, see: EMPLOYEES MUST WASH HANDS BUT EVERYONE ELSE? YOU DO YOU, which is kind of like saying IT IS WHAT IT IS, which is a kind of LET IT BE.<br />

DON’T WORRY; BE HAPPY<br />

It’s like that part in the bible when god thought it was all just good.</p>

          <div><p>Growing up, from swing set<br />
to cigarettes, my street had no swimming<br />
pool, only bent circles<br />
with no net, metal hoops<br />
nothing<br />
to catch inflated or pass,<br />
except blunts packed<br />
from older brothers<br />
who rode a different bus<br />
and all wore the same color.<br /><br />

Haircuts were tell your mom<br />
if she has time for me<br />
after dinner.<br />
Not ask, because what’s grammar.<br />
What manners? We’re neighbors.<br />
Our fathers carpool.<br />

On Fridays after work they drink<br />
together, sink bottles <br />
under<br />
steel-toed boots<br />
away from trashcans and wives<br />
and throw attention at neither<br />
except when there are messes<br />
to clean up.<br /><br />

What’s missing is replaced<br />
by what is there. <br /><br />

A living beat, rhythmic and organic our poetry<br />
is freestyle cyphers, flow calisthenics<br />
and eight-oh-eight olympics.<br /><br />

How else would you explain six streets<br />
and one stop? I guess that’s why<br />
we don’t<br /><br />

say no to a lung party</p>

heart next to yours<br /><br />

your music matches my outfit<br />

you are what i wanted <br />
and what i’ll regret giving up<br /><br />

spent too much time <br />
memorized in movements <br /><br />

like pulling the door <br />
open at the bank<br /><br />

taking out money to spend<br />
on each other instead of <br />
our futures we see in one self<br /><br /> 

and maybe it sounds cheesy<br />
or maybe they’ll get jealous <br />

by the many times each day<br />
you push contents thru me</p>

          <div><p>We are in a locomotive television.<br />
Our head is heavy of the phosphors. <br />
Glitch spills on our tongue.<br />
Vases are going off the rails, blue cells, sick berries.<br />
Endlessly in speed, our hands off the wheel. <br />
Rotten, hulled in our own battling skin, <br />
discordantly beaten throughout our membrane.<br />
Insane, swiped under stumps.<br />
Blackened spew forked our third eye blind.<br />
Hooked to the screw of pills murmuring us to keep calm.<br />
Dying inside trying, can't walk in the open<br />
because it is already too late.<br />
Shredded to worn, almost choking in the swarming <br />
dead gore germs from our own mouths.<br />
Our house has become a wolf hole.<br />
Feasting on cold bodies blue, <br />
eating the faces off of the unmindful.<br />
Our feet in the gruel of grey maggots, black cadavers<br />
and soft sad tissues. <br />
We are tricked, taken for a ride whenever <br />
we are to transpire tiredness from this horrid immoral reality.<br />
Nutmeg scattered on our nerves. <br />
We are too close to the television, our hair roots are dull. Tangles sea coral through our head.<br />
Witnessing our own self into the suction to not turn it off.<br />
We are in a locomotive television.</p>
