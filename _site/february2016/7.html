	<p><b>the elder scrolls</b><br /><br /><br />
the part in oblivion<br /><br />
where you go into the painting<br /><br />
and you have to fight the painted trolls<br /><br />
but you don&#39;t have enough turpentine arrows to defeat them<br /><br />
so you run up a hill<br /><br />
and try to cast fireballs at them<br /><br />
but their health regenerates too quickly<br /><br />
because the leveling up system is broken<br /><br />
and bethesda realized this and fixed it in skyrim<br /><br />
but you aren&#39;t playing skyrim<br /><br />
and now the trolls have murdered you<br /><br />
that&#39;s what it feels like not talking to you</p>
<p><br /><br /><br /></p>
<p><b>cheat code</b><br /><br /><br />
not feeling very motivated<br /><br />
not feeling very challenged by life<br /><br />
because i live in my childhood bedroom<br /><br />
this is life on easy mode<br /><br />
you can&#39;t get the best ending on easy mode<br /><br />
i don&#39;t care about endings or beginnings or the middle<br /><br />
mature people take coffee breaks at starbucks near their places of work while talking to other working people about work<br /><br />
they write short non emotional emails that refer to the contents of spreadsheets or other emails<br /><br />
they do this for forty to fifty years<br /><br />
i stare at a screen and wait for the internet to tell me what emotion to experience next<br /><br />
there is a gigantic hole in my mind that information technology plugs up<br /><br />
i try to imagine myself feeling worked up enough about life to scream silently in my head for three hours but i don&#39;t<br /><br />
i would flush this poem down the toilet but it’s on my macbook and that won&#39;t fit down the toilet even if i shatter it first<br /><br />
so instead i just stare at it and try to subtract any emotion­inducing lines or words out of it because aren&#39;t we past that stuff by now<br /><br />
imagine seagulls flying toward the sunset growing and expanding into Salvador Dali type creatures dripping liquid clocks over parked cars and pedestrians while humming chopin&#39;s nocturnes<br /><br />
would that be beautiful?<br /><br />
i don&#39;t know what is beautiful<br /><br />
this poem is an exegesis on continental philosophy and aesthetics<br /><br />
beautiful things disappear as you approach them<br /><br />
my computer is telling me not to get a job<br /><br />
i tell it ok<br /><br />
i feel better for a little while and then don&#39;t</p>
