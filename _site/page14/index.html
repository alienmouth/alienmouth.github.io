          <div><p><b>Circulars</b></p>
<p>Upstairs, the one legged man taps on the floor<br />
and I think it is someone knocking at our door.<br />
Sometimes when I am lying in bed<br />
I can hear him in the toilet.<br />
Our flats are laid out backward.<br />
His lounge is above my bedroom,<br />
his bedroom below our lounge.<br />
The kitchens are in completely different places.<br />
Once, Jackson said he could hear the <br />
one legged man peeing while he was peeing.<br /><br />

The one legged man leaves his newspapers on the footpath<br />
and his junk mail in the mailbox.<br />
We bring his junk mail down to him<br />
and put it on his barbecue,<br />
but it just ends up blowing around<br />
on our steps and getting caught out in the rain.<br /><br />

The one legged man stays home a lot.<br />
He watches a lot of movies and<br />
gets his food delivered from Countdown.<br />
The one legged man keeps his door open <br />
but I’ve only seen him once.<br />
The day we moved in,<br />
I knocked on his door frame.<br />
He came out and introduced himself.<br />
He said he likes to play music<br />
and we should tell him off if it gets too loud.<br />
The one legged man’s music is never too loud<br />
but it’s not enjoyable either.<br /><br />

The one legged man has two cats.<br />
They are both incredibly shy.<br />
One of them accepts pats<br />
but the other one will hide under the house <br />
if he sees you coming.<br />
One time, I sat down on the couch<br />
and the shy cat shot out from behind it<br />
and ran out the door.<br />
The one legged man seems nice enough.<br />
We borrowed his can opener once.</p>
<p>&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;</p>
<p><b>House</b></p>
<p>I tie a thread around my ankles
and lower my body down
beneath the deck
to watch the cats with human faces
clean themselves in the half-light
of their homes.

A zeppelin disguised as a kereru
propels itself magnificently
through the stratosphere overhead
and my person-eyes are transfixed
by the person-eyes in front of mine,
set in their frame of orange fur.

How far back does the person go,
I wonder –
as in, are they person-brains or cat-brains
living inside?

Their homes are so clean,
pitched roofs and whitewashed boards
fitted snug to the land,
the gentle roll of the hill.
It is hard to hold onto them,
hard to keep sight of their scale
as we tap dance on the lino 
above their heads.</p>
<p>&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;</p>
<p><b>Houseplants</b></p>
<p>Trees march down the window 
panes 
of all the apartment buildings
in straight diagonal lines.

A woman peers through the plants
in her window
and smiles as you pass.

Smile back.

A foot appears in the gutter,
lonely,
pierced by a metal rod.

Pick it up and 
place it in your bag.</p>

          <br><span class="smaller">by Jackson Nieuwland on February 14, 2016</span>  <br/>
          <div><p>Bianca had to move to the new school because an earthquake broke her old school. The ground swallowed all the buildings. The new school was full of sparrows. When they came into the classrooms it was not the usual chaos of hollow bones slamming into double glazed glass and feathers floating slowly to the floor to be picked up, one at a time, by small fingers, during the end of day tidy up. The birds knew their way around. They never entered accidentally through open windows, always came in politely through the front door and, when they were ready, exited the same way.</p>

<p>Occasionally a child would arrive at school in the morning to find a nest had been built in their desk overnight, their books torn to shreds and woven into an origami home for eggs which was not to be disturbed until the caretaker had a spare minute to relocate it to a nearby treetop. When teachers ran out of activities for their students, they had them make bird feeders to join the multitudes that hung all around the school like fire alarms, but the sparrows were more interested in the children’s lunches, so occasionally you would see a five year old who had thrown all his chips to the birds sucking on a peanut butter smeared pinecone.</p>

<p>Bianca hadn’t been told any of this. On her first day at the school, the principal pointed her to a classroom and the teacher pointed her to a desk. She sat, without first looking down at the chair, and felt a crunch flow into wetness on the back of her new tan skirt with the owl print. She had worn it to look nice because she didn’t have a school uniform yet. Quickly standing, she looked down at the chair and saw a flattened bird’s nest with a dead something inside. Her eyes went wide and she rushed out of the class.</p>

<p>On her way to the sickbay to get a change of clothes Bianca walked past the staffroom, where every morning, before the nine o’clock bell rang, the teachers huddled around the coffee table, kneeling on the carpet, and did lines of cocaine. They needed the hit in order to deal with the children’s endless Whys. Then they needed another hit at morning tea, one at the beginning of lunch and another at the end of it. The cleaners, who came every night, were not given keys to the staffroom. They were told the teachers cleaned it themselves to set a good example for the children. The cleaners didn’t think this was working very well judging from the mess in the classrooms that they were paid to remove.</p>

<p>When Bianca got back to class in a borrowed, too tight, pair of jean shorts everyone was sitting in a circle on the floor sharing their news. They stood one at a time and, while the rest stared up at them, started with Did You Know.<br />
“Did you know I went to the supermarket.”<br />
“Did you know Amelia came to my house.”<br />
“Did you know I have this.”<br />
A toy truck, a new lunchbox, an empty Pepsi Max bottle. Bianca hung back in the doorway searching for her spot in the circle, but there was no extra space. A boy stood up.<br />
“Did you know that girl killed a bird,” he said, pointing straight at Bianca.<br />
Everyone looked at her with expressions on their faces. She ran back out of the classroom and sat under a tree until the teacher came out fifteen minutes later and brought her back in, while the other kids were doing their handwriting.</p>

<p>The next day Bianca returned wearing a new school uniform, the borrowed jeans freshly washed and folded in a plastic bag in her hand. She returned them to the front desk at the office.<br />
“Well aren’t you looking smart today,” said the receptionist.<br />
Bianca didn’t respond with words but gave a small smile and looked down quickly.<br />
“Better run to class dear,” the receptionist said, kindly giving Bianca a way out of the situation.<br />
She nodded and rushed out of the office. She sprinted across the playground and into her classroom even though there were still five minutes til the bell rang and all the other children were playing outside. She sat in the room alone, staring at her cellphone. The battery had died on her way to school and the black screen looked like a bottomless pool of water. When the other students eventually trickled into the classroom they didn’t greet her, but they didn’t mention the incident from the day before either.</p>

<p>The first part of class, as always, was news. The teacher sat on a chair while the students formed a circle on the floor, each with a toy or accessory or new item of clothing clasped tight in their hands. The teacher coughed. The children began sharing their news, their Did You Knows. It came around to Bianca.<br />
“Do you have anything to tell us about, Bianca,” said the teacher.<br />
Bianca shook her head and looked up at the white ceiling. There were thousands of tiny, perfectly circular, holes. They moved on to the next boy in the circle.<br />
“Did you know my daddy has new running shoes.”</p>

<p>The next day, at the beginning of lunch, Bianca slipped on a patch of bird droppings, grazing her knee. She sat, crying on the concrete, with her legs pulled up to her chest. The principal happened to be walking past. He knelt down.<br />
“Is it your first day of school,” he said.<br />
“Yes. No. It’s my third day,” said Bianca.<br />
“That’s nice. You’ll be okay.”<br />
The principal rubbed her back and then wandered off. Five minutes later he was in the staffroom, doing two lines of coke back to back. Two friendly children came up to Bianca and helped her to the sick bay where the office receptionist cooed over her.<br />
“You are having a tough week, aren’t you.”</p>

<p>On Thursday Bianca skipped her turn at news again. At lunchtime she hung out with the boy and girl who had helped her the day before. They played a game where they told Bianca to run around a block of buildings. Each time, when she got back, they told her she had either gone too fast or too slow and she had to do it again. It was her best day at the school yet.</p>

<p>The next morning when it came to her turn at news, and the teacher asked if she had anything to share, Bianca said yes. The teacher blew her nose.<br />
“Bless you,” said Bianca.<br />
She stood up and smoothed out her skirt with her palms, wiping the sweat off them at the same time.<br />
“Off you go,” said the teacher as she scratched the edge of her nostril.<br />
A bird hopped in through the doorway.</p>

<p>“Did you know last night I had a bad dream,” said Bianca.<br />
The teacher’s nose began running. She dabbed at it with a tissue, focusing on Bianca’s story.<br />
“I can’t remember all of it, just some bits.”<br />
The bird hopped further into the room.<br />
“My daddy was there.”<br />
The teacher scrunched up her nose and blew it again.<br />
“He was chasing me.”<br />
She looked down at the tissue and saw a bloody snot glob oozing in the centre of it. She quickly tucked it behind her back. The bird extended its wings and wobbled into the air.  It veered left into a window, banging the glass, and losing two feathers which floated slow down to the floor. A few children glanced over at it but quickly switched their attention back to Bianca’s story.<br />
“He had a egg beater but big.”</p>

<p>A drip of blood leaked from one child’s nose, but he didn’t notice it. While listening to Bianca, he licked his upper lip without registering the salty taste on his tongue.<br />
“He said he wanted to tell me something.”<br />
The blind bird bashed repeatedly into the window, losing more feathers, but no one heard the noise over Bianca’s quiet voice. Blood was running freely from the teacher’s nose now.<br />
“We were in the hallway and I started running.”</p>

<p>More of the children’s noses started bleeding. The teacher’s head dropped to her chest, the front of her blouse staining red, tissues slipping from her hand. The bird swooped across the room, slamming into the opposite window and falling to the floor.<br />
“The hall just kept getting longer and longer and the walls were covered in pictures I had drawn.”<br />
One of the boys stuck two fingers up his nostrils, then pulled them out and began fingerpainting deformed red circles on his arm. The teacher slumped forward, her face in a pool of blood in her lap.</p>

<p>“There was a mirror at the end of the hall but I couldn’t see myself in it, just my Dad winding the egg beater faster and faster.”<br />
Children were collapsing all around her but Bianca wasn’t paying any attention, she was too busy making up her story.<br />
“I heard my Mum’s voice from the other room yelling to hurry up.”</p>

<p>The bird staggered through the air in short leaps to land in the centre of the circle while the last few children collapsed. It hopped around, tapping it’s beak on fallen children’s shoes. Then it returned to the centre of the circle, wearing half as many feathers as it had when it entered, and flew straight out the front door. Two more birds flew into the room. Then they flew back out. Then another four flew in. They circled the room a few times before coming down to land, hopping over the bodies.</p>
<p>“That’s all I can remember.”<br />
Bianca noticed a small bloodstain on the sleeve of her shirt from the boy sitting to her left. Thinking she might be bleeding herself, she quietly exited the room and walked to the sick bay, crunching fallen leaves under her new sneakers. When she stepped into the office building the receptionist looked up at her.<br />
“More trouble sweetheart.”<br />
Bianca held up her sleeve in explanation.</p>

<p><b>Nevereverland Notes on (de)Tethered Togetherness</b></p>
<p>1. Fluidity of friction is a (con)sensual (con)tradiction. For ‘we’ need to be one and other in order to organize across oceans. The one sees all the same sea, but must free messages to distant spirits floating beyond bridge of me-we-being. To do so requires fine signal reception. Therefore everything visible operates as symbol, like flesh and fabric of skin, foretelling futures for kin lines to come. [Theory of Scattered Islands]</p>

We humans are a hot dog sold in a baseball stadium, where unknown union of molecular money chemistry balances circular corporal composition: a ball, that is, the game, gambler’s dance, people play of bouncing possibilities (like eating ‘pork et al.’ in a white bread bun), swinging bat screeching, "Win!

          <a href="/reviews/salt.html"><h3 class="contrast">Salt is for Curing: A Review</h3></a>
          <br><span class="smaller">by Christopher Morgan on January 15, 2016</span>  <br/>
          <div><p>Freshly served by Sator Press, Sonya Vatomsky&rsquo;s first full-length collection, &ldquo;Salt is For Curing&rdquo; uses its dark feasts and folklore to explore the frailty of our memories and bodies. With photography by Sator&rsquo;s founding editor, the cover&rsquo;s salt circle invokes and repels darkness, sealing the poems within. Guiding readers through its three courses, Vatomsky&rsquo;s poetry is a truly generous offering, complete with aperitif and digestif.</p>

<p>As the title reminds how we can hold onto things for an almost unnatural length of time, much of this collection commemorates what&rsquo;s passed. The opening poem, &ldquo;Bathymetry,&rdquo; stretches from old legends of empowerment and oppression all the way to the present, as we&rsquo;re told: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the kind of light / you name galaxies after. / Andromeda, for example, / which means &ldquo;ruler of men&rdquo; / so, of course / they stripped her naked and chained her / to a rock&rdquo; (11). Like a dinner toast for a death, this collection&rsquo;s recurring spells and other forms crystallize facts for future audiences:</p>
<p><br />
<br />
 </p>
<div class="inline_poem" style="text-align: justify"><b>&ldquo;Apotheosis&rdquo;</b><br />
<br />
The recipe called for murder; I did not misread it:&nbsp;6 SPRIGS FRESH DILL, as much&nbsp;SALT&nbsp;as you can stand,&nbsp;and take a&nbsp;KNIFE&nbsp;to the one that failed you.&nbsp;1 WHOLE POTATO, 1 WHOLE CARROT. You will not be cold this winter, you will not.&nbsp;Locate the&nbsp;JOINT, move the&nbsp;BONE&nbsp;back and forth; it can be&nbsp;hard to find the&nbsp;ARTICULATION POINT&nbsp;with the sobs still lodged&nbsp;in your throat like fish bones. Chop the&nbsp;DILL&nbsp;into fine green shards;&nbsp;they are the forest you bury him in. They are the fog&nbsp;on the fallen leaves on the wet snow on the soil. They are the wood frog and the arctic lamprey and the brown bear&nbsp;leaving trails in the opposite direction. Use your&nbsp;KNIFE&nbsp;to&nbsp;TRIM excess&nbsp;FAT,&nbsp;REMOVE&nbsp;the&nbsp;BONE&nbsp;with minimal damage&nbsp;to the meat, turn his memory to the grounds that sit&nbsp;at the bottom of your porcelain cup painted in wild strawberries: a fortune teller&rsquo;s ephemera. Use the tip of your&nbsp;KNIFE &mdash; not the blade,&nbsp;lest he leave rings on you like an aging tree &mdash; in short&nbsp;flicking motions.&nbsp;REMOVE&nbsp;the&nbsp;BONE&nbsp;with minimal damage&nbsp;to the meat. As much&nbsp;SALT&nbsp;as you can stand, rubbed the way you&rsquo;d rub&nbsp;an ache until it gives in beneath you. Little peat bog, little бог,&nbsp;little God. Ivan the Fool slept on an oven and so will you. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (34)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;</div>

<p>Whether by broiling, carving, or extracting, these poems address grief on their own terms. Blending personal experience with instruction, Vatomsky teaches us that tears are a surprisingly fine substitute for most ingredients, and that, &ldquo;To brew a love potion is to kill yourself but to poison is to breathe&rdquo; (71). But these poems also serve as timelines, occupying the past to resist forgetting. With its many references to food and language, &ldquo;Salt is For Curing&rdquo; blurs the line between identity and context, and how we place ourselves within our own history.</p>

<p>Yet these poems recognize that no amount of salt can preserve something forever. Food must be eaten, or it perishes. Bodies must be buried, or hidden. Leading us into the swamplands by a &ldquo;chain of rope and scarves,&rdquo; the speaker laments: &ldquo;I am being carefully and / systemically forgotten&rdquo; (22), as if even memories decay in the mire. But these poems know the dirty details required for moving on, whether from a stern mother&rsquo;s advice, or somebody who&rsquo;s learned the &ldquo;safest place to bury a body / is in another body / is in your own body&rdquo; (17). Vatomsky knows we learn through pain&mdash;licking our wounds until the taste of blood no longer scares us&mdash;as a witch &ldquo;can only be burned so many times before she thinks hmm / something has got to change here&rdquo; (73).</p>

<p>&ldquo;Salt is For Curing&rdquo; offers the ultimate reward in exchange for your darkest red. Making a thick paste from a phoenix&rsquo;s bones to reexamine resurrection myths, these poems count all 32 teeth, then eat your words with bread. Sonya Vatomsky reflects upon salt and suffering, creating a literary love potion that&rsquo;s equal parts wishing well and butcher&rsquo;s hook.</p>
