          <div><p><b>Little ghost</b><br />
<br />
grief can be milk<br /><br /></p>

<p>or it can be two boys standing at a window<br /></p>

<p>looking out at baby clothes<br /></p>

<p>left hanging on the washing line for weeks<br /><br /></p>

<p>can be a kind of fraying in the breeze<br /><br /></p>

<p>can be little blankets<br /></p>

<p>muslin sheets and little boots<br /></p>

<p>hanging in the air<br /></p>

<p>like little ghosts<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>At the truck-stop on the edge of town</b><br />
<br />
           we pull in with the gauge a line above empty<br /></p>

<p>out of fuel and out of money<br /></p>

<p>but Hercules gets out and fills the tank anyway.<br /></p>

<p>The pump churns like a bad heart,<br /></p>

<p>pulling blood from somewhere underneath our feet<br /></p>

<p>and through the screen I watch<br /></p>

<p>a thousand moths all hurl themselves<br /></p>

<p>against the god-lights, fall away in rapture<br /></p>

<p>then hurl themselves again.<br /></p>
<p align="right">
    Inside, a TV plays a rerun of The Green Berets.<br />

    Old John Wayne appears on screen, rifle in hand,<br />

    as Herc walks in like an empire of blood,<br />

    nods to the counter man,<br />

    counter-man nods back, Herc goes outside and sits and waits<br />

    for someone. And so we wait, long enough for old John Wayne<br />

    to press his mouth against a landscape,<br />

    to resurrect a myth then watch it burn again.<br />

    to become a gun, then a father,<br />

    then a mean drunk, then a gun again.<br />

    Long enough for old John Wayne<br />

    to swallow it and call it history,<br />

    to bleed a nation white,<br />
</p>
<p><br /><br />
Outside, a trucker pulls in and eyeballs Herc<br /></p>

<p>who looks clean through the world<br /></p>

<p>and sees a howling dark beneath it.<br /></p>

<p>Or perhaps he sees himself.<br /></p>

<p>Either way he nods to the trucker<br /></p>

<p>and they disappear around the corner.<br /></p>
<p align="right">
    On screen, old John Wayne gets cancer,<br />
    reaches his big hands down his big neck,<br />
    pulls out a sick lung, part of his stomach,<br />
    four white ribs, three sets of divorces papers,<br />
    the gun his second wife tried to shoot him with,<br />
    reaches further, pulls out more guns, a playboy interview,<br />
    the confederate flag,<br />
    white supremacy, a lynch mob, pulls out empire,<br />
    pulls out more guns,<br />
    reaches further in, pulls out genocide,<br />
    pulls out the trail of tears,<br />
    Wounded Knee, reaches further and further<br />
    til he can only pull himself from himself<br />
    and from himself he pulls the final scene from The Green Berets,<br />
    which is to say inside of John Wayne there is a small boy<br />
    who is always running out onto a greying beach.<br />
    The boy always calls for someone, finds no one calling back.<br />
    Old John Wayne always follows, takes the hand of the boy<br />
    says "you're what this is all about."<br />
</p>
<p><br />
Herc comes back then, fist full of bills and hard blank.<br /></p>

<p>He doesn’t look at me, doesn’t look at anything,<br /></p>

<p>just unfolds a bill and slides it to the counter-man.<br /></p>

<p>His whole body says it’s time for us to go<br /></p>

<p>as the air swells up like blood.<br /></p>

<p>Outside the morning breaks like a bad heart<br /></p>

<p>bleeding red across the sky<br /></p>
<p align="right">
    while old John Wayne and the boy -<br />

    they walk into horizon.<br />

    John Wayne and the boy -<br />

    they are walking into nothing.<br />
</p>
<p><br /><br /><br />
<b>At the coast, Hercules, least mortal of us all, tells the sea what it means to die.</b><br /><br />
Do you know the problem<br /></p>

<p>with all language?<br /><br /></p>

<p>How to speak of the dead.<br /><br /></p>

<p>“And so he died,<br /></p>

<p>went down into the ground<br /></p>

<p>or up into the air etc.”<br /><br /></p>

<p>But dying’s not a disappearing trick.<br /></p>

<p>There’s no trapdoor out the body.<br /></p>

<p>Death is the world under erasure.<br /></p>

<p>Proof that there was never anyone inside.<br /></p>

<p>You want a metaphor for dying?<br /></p>

<p>Take everything you ever wrote<br /></p>

<p>and burn it.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Then gather up and burn the ash.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Then burn the space that’s left behind.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<b>Interlude (2) / notes from an incomplete drama / 3rd person omniscient </b><br /><br />
<b>ACT 1</b><br /><br />
<i>Iphicles and the boy called C are imagined here as field and presence which is to say they are two shapes unfolding from a single plane which is to say something like the ‘immanence of one within its other’  which is to say that C already holds the whole of Iphicles inside his mouth. In any case, the scene is ext and the sky is blue, blue, blue.</i><br /><br /></p>

<p>C:   What’s it like living with all those bones?  <br /><br />
Iphicles: (<i>question mark</i>)  <br /><br />
C: Over the fence I mean. In the cemetery.<br /><br />
  Iphicles: (<i>small sound</i>)  <br /><br />
C:    You ever wonder what people look like after they go into the ground? I think they probably look like roots. Or water.<br /><br /> 
  Iphicles: (<i>smaller sound</i>)  <br /><br />
C: I wonder sometimes what my daddy would look like in the ground. Or maybe just his hands.  <br /><br />
Iphicles: (<i>the colour red</i>) (<i>a kind of static</i>)   <br /><br /><br />
<b>ACT 2</b><br /><br />
<b>SCENE 1  </b><br /><br />
<i>In the afternoon, C shows Iphicles a trick at the river. C lays belly down on the jetty, holds his hands beneath the water and starts to sing a gentle silverness. Within a minute a catfish has risen up and set its belly in his hands. C looks up. Smiles like a waking sky. Like an answer to the one big question. Iphicles thinks this is the most amazing thing he’s ever seen.</i><br /><br />
<b>SCENE 2  </b><br /><br />
<i>Later, as the sun sets and the empty of the house grows, Iphicles stands at the doorway looking out as C trip-traps his littleway away, away, we’re sad to say, and up the hill and as he goes everything becomes little and his little hands are the little thing that Iphicles will set his gaze on as he goes.</i><br /><br />
<b>SCENE 3  </b><br /><br />
<i>When C is gone from sight, the world comes back into a heaviness. Iphicles feels night falling over everything. He turns and climbs the stairs. In his room, he falls face down on his bed. Hugs nothing. The red noise in him swells. The house braces.</i><br /><br />
<b>ACT 3  </b><br /><br />
Iphicles: (<i>unpunctuated howl</i>)</p>

Half baked mountains observe the asphalt arteries we are pumping thru<br />

on the run from boredom <br />
&amp; boredom’s burning coat of years<br />
trailing along the experiential embers <br />
that shine light from your belly <br />
illuminating the naked buried in your skin.<br />
There’s a prickly pear beer top in my pocket <br />

yet to scratch the record player mind.<br /></p>

          <br><span class="smaller">by Greg Letellier on August 1, 2015</span>  <br/>
          <div><p><i>“The next night we ate whale.<br />
The next night we ate whale.”<br />
-Tao Lin</i></p>
<p align="center">i.</p>
<p>A whale is inside of a whale.<br />Inside that whale is another whale.<br />Inside <i>that</i> whale? Me and Horace.<br />I call out to Horace, who’s currently trying to pry its jaw open. He’s one of these lughead types: all glamour muscle, clean-cut, neanderthal. His pride and joy is his willingness to resort to grunts and biceps.<br />“Dummy,” I say. “It’s a moot point. There are too many whales.”<br />He turns, gives up. “Bro,” he says. “Your pessimism might have helped you get a philosophy degree, but it won’t help here.”<br />“You’re wasting your strength,” I say, sitting cross-legged.<br />“Brosef,” Horace says. “We won’t get anything done if you keep sitting Indian-style and running your mouth.”<br />“It’s not Indian-style,” I say.<br />“We’re beyond politics,” Horace says. “Like we’re in a whale’s mouth, dude. There aren’t politics in here. And there sure as heck aren’t Indian people.”<br />“Three whales’ mouths.”<br />“Well,” he says. “That supports my point. We are far from Indian-folk.”<br />A rumble echoes up from the stomach. A burp? A fart? We lean in, listen.<br />Then, silence.<br />“False alarm,” Horace says.<br />I sigh and sit back down, not cross-legged.<br />“Anyway,” Horace says, and then stops talking.<br />“What? Anyway what?”<br />“I don’t know.”<br />“Ok.”<br />“Wanna play desert island?”<br />“No,” I say.<br />“Ok,” Horace says. “Let’s play Whale Mouth.”<br />“What the fuck is that?”<br />“It’s simple,” says Horace. “Name three things you’d bring into a whale’s mouth if you knew you’d have to be stuck there forever.” <br />“Three whales’ mouths,” I say. “And we won’t be here forever.”<br />“Is that optimism I hear?”<br />“Shut up.”<br />“I’ll go first,” Horace says. “Two thirty-five pound dumbbells, a six pack of Guinness, and a box of a dozen protein bars.”<br />“That was more than three things.”<br />“How?”<br />“Two dumbbells, six beers, and twelve protein bars? That’s like twenty things.”<br />“It <i>is</i> twenty things.”<br />“You said three.”<br />“Whatever,” Horace says, crossing his arms. “There is no math here, anyway.”</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p align="center">ii.</p>
<p>Call me Ishmael.<br />
Because that’s my actual name.<br />
I wash dishes at the brewery near the highway.<br />
Oh, and the answer is no: I’ve never read Moby Dick.<br />
I get a lot of those jokes.<br />
I want to be left alone.<br />
But of course, the new girl Tammy comes in a fucks with me, because of my name. She just graduated with a degree in American Literature, and now she works at a brewery because the job market is terrible, especially for people who study literature.<br />
Anyway, she rattles a cup of Starbucks Iced Coffee in my face.<br />
“Ok,” I say. “What.”<br />
“Get it?” she asks.<br />
“No.”<br />
“Starbucks.”<br />
“Ok?”<br />
“Starbuck.”<br />
“I got nothing.”<br />
“He’s a character in Moby Dick.”<br />
“Oh.”<br />
“And you’re the first sentence.”<br />
“Ok.”<br />
Tammy leans into the sink, sniffs. “It smells funny in these sinks.” She points down. “Like, it smells like legit antelope shit.”<br />
“Antelope shit?”<br />
“I don’t know. Fuck. Shit in general, I guess.”<br />
“Ok.”<br />
“You should clean them better.”<br />
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p align="center">iii.</p>
<p>Fourteen whales walk into a bar.
The bartender says, “We don’t allow whales in here.” To further convey his refusal to serve whales, he points to a sign that reads: “NO WHALES ALLOWED ANYMORE! NO SPERM WHALES, NO HUMPBACK WHALES...NO WHALES OF ANY KIND!!!!!!!!!”<br />
“Sorry,” the first whale says, turning to leave. <br />
“Sorry,” the second whale says, turning to leave. <br />
“Sorry,” the third whale says, turning to leave. <br />
“Sorry,” the fourth whale says, turning to leave. <br />
“Sorry,” the fifth whale says, turning to leave. <br />
“Sorry,” the sixth whale says, turning to leave.<br />
“Sorry,” the seventh whale says, turning to leave.<br />
“Sorry,” the eighth whale says, turning to leave.<br />
“Sorry,” the ninth whale says, turning to leave. <br />
“Sorry,” the tenth whale says, turning to leave. <br />
“Sorry,” the eleventh whale says, turning to leave. <br />
“Sorry,” the twelfth whale says, turning to leave. <br />
“Sorry,” the thirteenth whale says, turning to leave. <br />
The fourteenth whale, however, is quiet, contemplative. He is mad. He walks out of the bar, beats up a college kid, steals his clothes. He walks back into the bar, wearing a Red Sox hat and a polo from American Eagle.<br />
Inside the bar, trying to play it cool, he takes a seat. The bartender looks at him and smiles.<br />
“Welcome,” he says. “What are we having tonight?”<br />
“Gin and tonic.”<br />
“Any preference on the gin?”<br />
“Um,” the fourteenth whale says. “Beefeater, I suppose.”<br />
“Beefeater it is,” the bartender says.<br />
 The whale smiles, but before the drink can even be made, it hits him: he is a fraud, a loser, a bad friend, a whale. He stands up, feeling guilty that he is betraying his friends. He starts sweating, crying, swearing. He runs out of the bar, and the bartender says, “That guy was weird,” but the fourteenth whale doesn’t care. He jumps over the college kid, naked and passed out in the street, and sprints home. <br />
When he enters their apartment, the thirteen other whales look up and smile. They are drinking Fireball Whiskey and playing Mario Kart on WiiU. <br />
“We missed you,” the sixth whale says.<br />
“Yes,” says the eleventh. “We missed you a lot.”<br />
“Have a drink,” says the first whale.<br />
The fourteenth whale is moved to tears of joy by the sheer magnitude of kindness that surrounds him.<br />
<i>The moral of this story is if you have a 1,300 pound heart, fucking use it.</i>
