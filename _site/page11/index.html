          <br><span class="smaller">by Ricky Garni on March 19, 2016</span>  <br/>
          <div><p>I would like to build a movie of your life that lasted a lifetime. And this life follows another.  And that life follows this. Therefore a lifetime would be forever. I am ready to make this movie. I am ready to watch this movie. And now I will. And so I will go. I am ready. I think you will be happy. It’s time for us to enjoy the rest of our lives. For the movie to begin.  Just look at the curtains, how wonderful they are, how they open like birds at a window, dying to be outside.</p>

<p><b>I Declare</b><br /><br />

If you say I love you enough, it sounds just like a rock skipping on a frozen lake, which you would think would sound really sharp and hard, but it actually sounds just like mallard ducks looking for little fish under the ice of a frozen lake.

“I love you,” the mallard ducks say to the little fish, frozen in the lake.

          <br><span class="smaller">by Brittany Swenson on March 19, 2016</span>  <br/>
          <div><p>Doom trickles. Is it sweat? A cold perspiration? A delusion. Stabbed by realness. Blade serving as a medium. But the blade is a butter knife. Not to be taken seriously. Don’t misconstrue a few scratches for a gauging wound. Don’t let this medium belittle you. Yet here I am on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Crybaby. Not nurtured properly. My mother was 23 when she had me. She could hardly nurture herself. Much less another human being. Compassion emits. As does resentment. Eddy of fusions. Seeing the line of division. Between self and self. They’re possessed by hate. It is this division which connects them. A shot of adrenaline jets upward. Jolted to extremities. When the external resource takes hold. Curse the hold. Never asked for it consciously. Maybe unconsciously. I did. What is this insane mirage known as Here and Now? As if we were flippantly thrown, a few crumbs to the wind, God ruffles It’s coat to It’s comfort – the wind is provoking a chill of some sort. Pigeons peck at me. For I am a mound of crumbling selves. Stomp me out. For the love of God stomp me out. Crush me into complacency. Maybe then I’d be okay.</p>

<p>I give forth to these images. Oblique and indifferent. The stare of white makes me shiver. For it is through the blankness that I see. Validation of the sight. I guess that’s what this is. Thanks for the opening, there. That good ol’ clearing. Here’s a yawn for every revelatory moment. Not even tired. But I figured I’d throw in a yawn. Because why not. Encompassing attitude: ‘why not?’ Death? Why not? Birth? Why not? Pain? Why not? Confidence? Why not? Truth? Why not? Maya? Why not? The senses peer in on themselves. Leaning in on their own secrets. Huffy breaths I’d imagine. Smelly and heavy. The feel of when a secret secretes itself upon the earlobe. Another shiver. Picture that. It does make sense. In a way. Numbers are not relevant here. No tally. No markup. No error. The error is of the whole thing, I think. Miraculous error. The joy of human constructs.</p>

<p>Oh, but I am on the run. On the run. On the run. Okayness is all I long for. I’m a child of the moon. A Cancer Goddammit. Ruled by the question of security. Ruled by the need to find home. To find home in sentences. To find home in touch. To find home in friendship. Think of the emotional validity behind father’s words. Inherent self entitlement – but not in the form of narcissism. I admire him. Grew up in the streets. Plagued. These streets are still smeared with dirt. And angry faces. Fucking miserable city, New York. Romanticize the gloom. This has been home. Gloom comes natural, here. The cramped shuffling. The gray and its gallop. It shuts this bravery like a clam. I wish I could live in bed.</p>

          <br><span class="smaller">by Ron Gibson on March 18, 2016</span>  <br/>
          <div><p>As I stood on the deck of a ferry, wind against my face, slicing<br />
through dark waters under blue sky, I thought about things on the<br />
borderlands of possible and impossible, like digitally-manipulated<br />
art. You seemed to be all around me: in the giggles of children, in<br />
the conversation of lovers, in the cries of hungry seagulls, as they<br />
conducted aerial maneuvers for alms.</p>

<p>I thought about beginnings and endings, and yesterdays and nows and<br />
tomorrows, and I could feel you there, a presence just beyond the<br />
periphery. Everything shouted, but only I could hear your name in the<br />
thick throats, in the sea hiss, in the engine rumble. I heard you<br />
somewhere over the Olympic mountain range, past the mountain goats<br />
past the snowcaps; you were where the sun lays down to die, and I<br />
thought of you dreaming by its side, content, full of love and loved<br />
in full.</p>

<p>Later, in the ferry terminal, I read fictional constructs from another<br />
time, from another place, and there was a certain heat in their<br />
fictional lives that felt familiar, that felt reflective of us,<br />
without actually being us.</p>

<p>I tried to explain to myself what ‘was,’ but still could not explain<br />
what ‘is.’ It was some foreign word on the tongue without translation;<br />
a novel not yet fully conceived; it was a song yet to be heard by<br />
ears, and it was the sonic boom that filled the skies with your<br />
pounding heart, as metal spires loomed into view on the horizon,<br />
growing larger and larger with your bright welcomes, until the sight<br />
was more than any one man could take.</p>

          <br><span class="smaller">by Hilton Hosannah on March 18, 2016</span>  <br/>
          <div><p>Gregory woke up, hungry and broke, not having eaten in four days. He got up from the bed, poured 180 proof Bacardi rum and San Pellegrino on top of ice cubes in a Solo cup, and then lit a half­finished cigarillo laying in the windowsill. The cell phone charging next to his pillow went off less that twenty minutes later; he shut it off and opened the Bank of America app. The money hadn’t come yet. A long drag of the cigarillo could soothe hunger pains but was also harsh on the throat, so Gregory punctuated each with a sharp swig from the cup. He didn’t like smoking and had quit cold turkey a week ago; a YouTube video of Christopher Hitchens, extolling the austerity found after a few puffs, coaxed him back. It only cost a dollar from the convenience store down the street to get a cigarillo, and he could make it another day without eating if he spread it out. Maybe he was just bad with money: the tip he left at Bonchon earlier in the week could have bought another week’s worth of cigarillos or half a handle of rum. Were his priorities in check? Was something wrong at home? Seems like you never think about things until they happen, Gregory thought to himself. He would text his mother, roll over in bed, and smoke and drink until he received an answer. If the money was in his account, he would leave the apartment and have a great day; if not, he would lay in bed and imagine he wasn’t so hungry. Maybe I should go to class today, Gregory thought. He threw the blanket over his head and closed his eyes. His brain felt tired. He heard the phone vibrate, opened one eye, and saw the soft green light blinking, like a distress call, in the darkness under the sheets. He checked his account and then imagined he wasn’t so hungry.</p>

          <br><span class="smaller">by Logan Ellis on March 18, 2016</span>  <br/>
          <div><p>p&gt;In the ocean trench of your dream, a version of yourself and I stretch a pun over fire, too consumed with survival to roast it to perfection. Together, we whisper to keep our arms from floating away. I remember how my voice shattered like glass and sank, how it continues to sink and sink, every piece running an impossible marathon against the others. In the end, no one has prepared you for the malice in the deep. We keep rings around our foreheads to hold it intact. Bloody pools in our bodies like headless horsemen. A phantom kite tied into the hopscotch of our ankles. A new animal whose skin is teeth that do not gnaw but molt and grow again. In the beginning, I tried so hard to learn the art of whistling.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p><b>dreamwear</b></p>

<p>In the church of your dream, a group of people is clustered together near the pulpit, wearing a similar-looking werewolf helmet matted with tears that did not come from their eyes, talking quietly with a scribbled whisper that isn’t coming from their mouths. A version of yourself walks in. “Why are you all wearing werewolf helmets?” You ask. “What, you didn’t bring your werewolf helmet?” They respond in unison. “No, what’s a werewolf helmet?” A boy revolves from the group like a shard of mirror. “The werewolf helmet does something different for everyone. The werewolf helmet hides the craters of light in Megan’s face; the werewolf helmet cools &amp; protects the desert brush in Johnny’s mouth; the werewolf helmet keeps Stanley’s diamond-cut bone structure from being scratched; the werewolf helmet takes Melissa’s head to another world, like an oasis on Mars; for me, the werewolf helmet carries
my eyes into a sky in the ocean, it makes me feel calm, held, unafraid. What would the werewolf helmet do for you? If my eyes weren’t deep inside my own werewolf helmet, I would tell you, because no one can see their own face—the mirror never tells the whole truth, just cuts it open and watches it bleed out. Go get a werewolf helmet and never take if off. Come back when we know for certain that you know for certain there’s something you want hidden, and that your werewolf helmet prevents any chance of us seeing it.” The boy revolves back into the group, sealing it shut. You go and exchange all of your jewelry for your own werewolf helmet, but when you come back, the group has shattered across the room, facing different directions. In the multicolored moonglow through the stained-glass window, you can see their heads alive and snapping like a wolf’s, their skin sharp and obsidian. At the center of the circle they had once made, a body lies torn, its insides pure and glass like a petrified chunk of wood. When you put on your werewolf helmet, all you see is a three-dimensional dark, fluid and optimistic, like a lie. From inside, you hear the wolves’ breathing move closer to you until you become the center of their circle, swimming under.</p>

<p><b>dreamvault</b></p>
<p>A list of items in the underground vault of your dream: 
•   a blind cough 
•   a discouraged closet, forever full 
•   a party of metallic hats, stray jackets, an athlete’s left crutch, my videogame manual from years ago 
•   the alphabet unraveling into something primordial, like 
o   microwaved tongues slouching for the cold 
•   animal meat on the floor, so old 
o   that it’s becoming an invention 
•   the eye sockets of a skeleton 
o   slouching flowers into the back of its throat 
•   the sunlight attempting 
o   to join hands 
♣   at the center of 
•   the earth.</p>

<p><b>dreamstone</b></p>

<p>In the clearing outside the small town of your dream, Viktor Shklovsky argues with stones. He wants them to be more like themselves (for the young artist’s sake) stonier than they ever were or ever will be. He’s opening his hands to read aloud the thousands of words etched into his palms, but he seems to be speaking with more than one voice, projecting inwards, outwards, beyond the forest and all of its forests, like how a kaleidoscope creates ghosts of the same color. He conjures pompoms and begins to cheer the stones on. S-T-O-N-E! Eventually, Shklovsky becomes such a dedicated fan that he curls into a stone himself. Oh, he says, now I am the stoniest of all. Imagine: a talking stone. It’s a spectacle. A couple from the small town discovers it talking to itself and reports to the mayor, who demands a stage be built around stone-Shklovsky and its frightening glory. The town begins charging a fee for anyone who wants to stop by and chat, making a fortune off tourists intrigued by the stone’s intelligence. Now, the town can afford to clean up the public transit and even bring in a Chipotle. Everyone begins to see things as more than just a classification; they see the city of veins in everything. Suddenly, Shklovsky’s speech is reduced to nouns and articles—A box. A chair.—but it’s okay because everyone knows what he means. No one is angry. But, over a span of days, he transforms back into human Viktor Shklovsky, retaining the nature of the stone—holding still, not talking. Despite the change, everyone still sees him as a stone, though tourism does begin to dwindle a bit. The small town reclines back into a state of drowsiness, while Shklovsky stands, even now, as stony as ever, the town’s citizens stopping by now and again to have a picnic in the clearing, or to sit next to him and enjoy a nice reflective silence, staring ahead and mouthing tiny words, Shklovsky, all the while, not saying one. He no longer needs to.</p>

<p><b>dreamhunger</b></p>

<p>In the badlands of your dream, a man cups a tiny, beached whale in his palm, taking a tiny spoon to its innards, grating along the dark pink meat, snapping the ribs up like seeds that failed to glimmer. “This is mine,” he says to himself, “I found it.”</p>
