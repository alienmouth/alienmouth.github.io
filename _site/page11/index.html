          <div><p>Let us take all the long time we need<br />
To wake up from our overdue dreams<br />
Get out of the bed, and stretch our<br />
Limbs as far as possible for a new morning</p>

<p>Let us take all the long time we need<br />
To listen to the first song of the birds<br />
Watch the rise of this summer sun, feel<br />
The breeze combing each tree with tenderness</p>

<p>Let us take all the long time we need<br />
To enjoy being together with our beloved<br />
Exchange a smile so that they can stay with<br />
Us just a few seconds or even minutes longer</p>

<p>Yes, let’s take all the long time we need<br />
To drink this tea, to chat about this weather<br />
To look back at the road we have travelled along<br />
To think, to cry, and to die in lingering twilight</p>

&amp; the things you made me feel in it <br />
made me feel like the train car<br />
(stained by clay/spring heat)<br />
(filled with abandoned wasps’<br />
nests you filled with cigarette<br />
breath til it dripped out like <br />
spit down your pretty mouth)<br />
(like some day a couple o’<br />
kids might just fall in love <br />
within my red rotting wood,<br />
their hands not touching but<br />
held somehow–i remember<br />
something in a science class<br />
about how we’re all always<br />
touching if you think about<br />
the body as a magnet &amp; <br />
since i’ve met you i’ve been<br />
thinking about my body as<br />
one of those little wooden<br />
train cars with the magnets <br />
on either end &amp; you as a <br />
train car with a magnet on <br />
both ends &amp; my heart’s a <br />
little kid with hands that <br />
keep pushing us together <br />
somewhere behind or <br />
beyond the tracks, beyond<br />
the smoke)</p>

It felt kind of butch, it felt like putting all my fingers in<br />
your mouth, it felt like penetration</p>

I say I love you like it’s water, like I<br />

	I say <i>aspen</i> meaning <i>elm</i> and <br />
	speak of the cottonwood. <br />
	The boy was not in love with <br />
	trains as the other boys were, <br />
	and ran from their distant <br />
	noise in terror, ran until a <br />
	parent scooped him up and <br />
	hugged him near. <i>Harmless</i><br />
	<i>time</i>, she whispers. Red is not, <br />
	however, obviously endless. I <br />
	watched three men grill three <br />
	rows of sausages each on <br />
	three grills facing the beach.<br /> 
	That was the morning after <br />
	the earthquake article, and <br />
	we all felt somewhat older. <br />
	Uncommon seeing. A habit <br />
	imbues what is hope with <br />
	actual practice.

          <div><p>Having a cat, used to talking<br />
to myself, there is a limit<br />
on how much catastrophe<br />
we can handle. 34 left<br />
at the nursing home to die<br />
fell on the bad side.<br />
Since when are we satisfied<br />
with a slow gouge without<br />
resolution and revelation<br />
of the emotion at play?<br />
There was a time when she<br />
cranked up the category, as if<br />
to say, Hey this is what a body<br />
looks like turned inside out!<br />
(I am talking to myself again)<br />
I reconcile that slush-thrower<br />
peeling back the city’s onion-<br />
strata with no space for grave-<br />
yards to stack bodies in layers.<br />
I’ve made sandwiches before,<br />
all the while talking to my cat,<br />
waiting for its backtalk.</p>
