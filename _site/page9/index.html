          <br><span class="smaller">by Jeremy Radin on June 22, 2016</span>  <br/>
          <div><p><strong>Dear Sal,</strong><br />
<br />
In a room on the river <br />
we crooned hymns <br />
to honeysuckle, eulogized <br />
a stuffed trout, carved nectarines <br />
&amp; waltzed within <br />
the scent. You fed me <br />
dark bread slathered in butter <br />
&amp; I did not speak of <br />
the French, the Germans, my mouth <br />
too full of sweetnesses. Your steady hands <br />
aglow, you touched me <br />
with such unbearable <br />
attention, accurate <br />
fingers unlacing the slaughter, <br />
numbers &amp; the names of countries <br />
crumbling in your eyes.<br />
<br />
<strong>Dear Sal,</strong><br />
<br />
For nearly a year I have been building a Word. <br />
Hammering letters together, welding with a torch<br />
that shoots a tongue-colored flame. I began<br />
<br />
my work while remembering your pinky. How she <br />
stands apart from all the others. They, a cluster <br />
of gossips; she, preening, disturbing the sensibilities. <br />
<br />
It is almost finished, the Word. I would say it here <br />
but the walls would come crashing down. I wish <br />
to say it in your house. In your father, mother,<br />
<br />
brother &amp; his twelve-gauge altar. Instead I holler <br />
recipes at lizards, cry Kaddish over birds that dash<br />
their brains out on the door. The Word is going <br />
<br />
extinct in my mouth. Sing with me, Bashert, once <br /> 
more. There is not enough room in the world<br />
for our silence.
<br />
<strong>Dear Sal,</strong><br />
<br />
Burning beds in a field I command the light, unleash it in the direction of your dress.<br />
I repeat your name to a cavalry of stars, hold to their noses a section of your dress.<br />
<br />
You found me trembling like a donkey at the altar, starving &amp; skinny, my hair a ghost’s nest.<br />
You took me inside to bind my wound in water, nourish me on the confection of your dress.<br />
<br />
A basket of peaches underneath your arm, the orchards of silence uprooted in your chest,<br />
you stroll through the blinding honeysuckle, its scent the only explanation for your dress.<br />
<br />
A sycamore sags on the side of a road, bones of a forgotten saint, unsung &amp; under-blessed.<br />
May you be delivered up from her roots, may you bloom in the rich salvation of her dress.<br />
<br />
How dark is the sum of the unburied dead? They scale the moonlight &amp; bellow distress.<br />
What relief awaits when you unfold the fabrics &amp; open the organization of your dress.<br />
<br />
Refugees cascade from the mouths whales, in a language of no they are the last remaining yes.<br />
I came from the dark with a war in my teeth, seeking clemency here in the nation of your dress.<br />
<br />
I die in in the tub as the coffee is brewing - I am lifted by the angels, I am lifted by regrets.<br />
I am brought back to life in a room on the river, howling about the negation of your dress.<br />
<br />
<strong>Dear Sal,</strong><br />
<br />
After all these years I’ve reached my age. To celebrate I eat a tuna salad on rye<br />
the size of a Buick. There is the mishegas &amp; there is the mishegas. The man who<br />
gave me a voice, he didn’t even speak the language. Oy, what a shondeh. Do you <br />
know what the word Bashert means? It means I would go back to Europe for you. <br />
I would eat mayonnaise on the Eiffel Tower. I would surround a tree with presents <br />
for the phantoms of our children, sing to the Rhine in the language of my people. <br />
If that, Bashert, is your wish. What have I been trying to say about desire? Stuffing <br />
tuna salad sandwich into my mouth. It is not something I can afford. At this time <br />
of day the park is almost empty. I want to hide in the grass &amp; make animal sounds,<br />
get the whole damn place to myself. Bashert, imagine! Just the two of us, strolling<br />
hand in hand, the beast of longing whimpering under our shoes. We call it longing <br />
because it takes forever. I am, years old. How can it matter? I hope somehow I have <br />
made you laugh. What do you call the most Jewish fish? The anchoyvey. I made that<br />
one up while the moon ate my legs. Ah yes, &amp; the shadow is mine. My beard, heavy <br />
with fish &amp; salt &amp; seeds. What do you call a garden on the bottom of the ocean? <br />
When the garden rises up in you, Bashert, what do you call?</p>

          <br><span class="smaller">by Christian Patterson on June 22, 2016</span>  <br/>
          <div><h2>Algona</h2>

<p>the wedding is at the house<br />
I’d drive to after track practice,<br />
the house she grew up in,<br />
where we’d play Beetle Adventure Racing<br /></p>

<p>the first time I went<br />
to Sarah’s house, I’d never taken that left<br />
in front of the SuperMall before,<br />
I didn’t know there was a town there,<br />
that I imagine exists as a self-sustained world<br />
built just for you, with a Dairy Queen<br />
and library<br /></p>

<p>those summer nights we’d go to the park<br />
across the street from Robyn’s house<br />
and push each other on the tire swing<br /></p>

<p>and after things changed,<br />
I was still friends with your sister<br />
I would swoop her in my truck<br />
and I would see you standing<br />
and watching<br /></p>

<h2>7-Eleven Part 2</h2>

<p>I walked to the 7-Eleven<br />
on the intersection of M and 8th Street,<br />
the one we’d go to after Monday track practice,<br />
the one across the street from Teriyaki Wok,<br />
where we drank Slurpees in the bed of my truck<br /></p>

<p>7-Eleven is now a boulangerie<br />
with floor to ceiling windows on a boulevard,<br />
watching bakers as they enter,<br />
I’m drinking banana flavored coffee<br /></p>

<p>I see nouveau riche in front of over-flowing<br />
trash cans eating foie gras and burger dogs,<br />
and the parks down the street, called Scootie Brown<br />
and Indian Tom, changed their names<br />
to Jamison Square and Tanner Springs<br /></p>

<h2>Secoma Lanes</h2>

<p>I’m imagining taking the drive<br />
to Pullman tomorrow instead,<br />
through the Cascades and Columbia,<br />
and the corn flowers blooming,<br />
and the green glow of a car dashboard<br />
in a rural college town<br /></p>

<p>I used a hookah for the first time in Pullman<br />
at a place called Munchy’z. I was 18,<br />
in town for ‘Imagine Tomorrow’,<br />
an alternative energy science fair<br /></p>

<p>I watched 6 hours of Intervention today<br />
it made me feel things<br />
that I’m not sure how to identify—<br />
I don’t know if I felt an amalgam of feelings<br />
or if I felt something that people don’t feel<br />
often enough to have named yet<br /></p>

<p>I watched a video on youtube about<br />
humans ceasing to exist<br />
they said whole neighborhoods<br />
would be up in smoke as soon as lightning struck<br /></p>

<h2>Seattle Aquarium</h2>

<p>Oliver is visiting from Australia<br />
I meet him and Zac at Alleyway<br />
I ask Oliver what Perth is like<br />
because I’m thinking about Susanna,<br />
and wondering if she still lives in Perth,<br />
or if she moved back to her small city in Japan<br /></p>

<p>Oliver tells me about the difference<br />
between Melbourne and Sydney until<br />
I feel interested in Australia—<br />
not for a previous lack of interest,<br />
I just already think so much<br />
about so many places<br /></p>

<p>I mention a memory from senior prom:<br />
we went to Chase’s—a split level house,<br />
with meat rotting on the dining room table<br />
and yellow cigarette tar on the walls<br /></p>

<p>we smoked Backwoods inside,<br />
Chase was stoned and Kirk played<br />
Beach House over the speakers,<br />
and Chase said ‘this music scares me’<br /></p>

<p>Earlier that night, prom was at the Seattle Aquarium,<br />
and after eating too much fondue,<br />
I went to a concrete observation deck,<br />
looked up at downtown Seattle.<br />
the world seemed lonely and big<br /></p>

<p>I go to Zac’s to sleep on his couch<br />
because I missed the last bus home<br /></p>

<p>after prom, as the sun came up,<br />
everyone went to bed on Chase’s basement floor<br />
I drove my mom’s minivan home<br />
across Auburn, so she could use it that morning<br /></p>

<p>earlier on prom night, Isaiah stopped by Chase’s<br />
his tie was loosened and his collar undone<br />
‘I had the best sex of my life in the car’, he said<br />
I think he conceived his firstborn that night<br /></p>

<h2>christmas lights</h2>

<p>I want to watch Dragon Ball Z with you<br />
you’re in Washington with me<br />
but you’re in Seattle and I’m in Auburn<br />
you’re in a motel and I’m on Kirk’s back patio<br />
and I don’t know even if you like Dragon Ball Z<br /></p>

<p>spaces feel different when the spaces<br />
are related to other space in a new way<br />
like when I stopped by 7-Eleven<br />
on the way home from working<br />
at the carnival, I saw it as an island<br />
in darkness and I didn’t know<br />
Dairy Queen was across the street<br /></p>

<p>but then I learned that behind that Dairy Queen<br />
is what would become your house<br />
and that 7-Eleven became part of the fabric<br />
of something much bigger<br /></p>

<p>I imagine you went to a Chinese garden,<br />
I see you behind a tea house and pond<br />
you are standing perfect and perfectly still,<br /></p>

<p>I want to see you under<br />
the Christmas lights above my bed,<br />
that make your stomach skin look blue—<br />
every color of light is within those Christmas lights,<br />
so why does your skin only reflect blue?<br /></p>

<h2>hot tub</h2>

<p>I remember at one of Jack’s big house parties,<br />
not long before college,<br />
I crawled into the hot tub in my underwear<br />
four people joined me, including<br />
Dwight and Danielle—they were dating at the time<br />
we talked about the future and high school<br /></p>

<p>we climbed on to the trampoline<br />
and we laid flat on our backs<br />
in the young, breezy, summer,<br />
night air like a heated swimming pool<br /></p>

<p>Kirk played his guitar laying down<br />
we looked at space,<br />
and talked to each other without<br />
ever looking away from that canopy<br />
that looked like negative exposures<br />
of a stucco ceiling, and the whole time<br />
you kept chain smoking on the back porch<br /></p>

:: foliage<br />
summer is long gone<br />
winter is yet to come<br />
let alone the spring but<br />
let me come to think of it;<br />
about the brown fall for<br />
it can be a perfect lesson<br />
about how death, of leaves<br />
and living things, at the very<br />
least, is beautiful and<br />
ephemeral and beautiful and<br />
ephemeral and be—<br />
<br />
ii.<br />
:: apollo<br />
exploding tanks, wasted oxygen,<br />
choked throats, dry lungs, almost lost<br />
forever in foreign space and home;<br />
but home was the last thing we recalled<br />
because the suits that allowed us to walk<br />
inside this zero gravity cubicle<br />
needed to call a small station in that<br />
rotting blue planet, first of all<br />
we were almost forever lost<br />
yet home was calling us home<br />
<br />
iii.<br />
:: postman<br />
he gazes through the window<br />
and mumbles about loneliness;<br />
of himself, stamp and airmail,<br />
an old office he will someday leave<br />
for retirement but then he checks his<br />
phone and giggles and stops mumbling<br />
<br />
iv.<br />
:: astral<br />
look at the girl in sweater<br />
and brunette milk braids<br />
crying while knotting the<br />
dead dots beyond the skies<br />
we can hear you, little girl<br />
don’t hope for silly things like<br />
getting new band merch for<br />
christmas or losing weight<br />
to the constellations because<br />
even when we have lived here<br />
for million years, we are still<br />
unseen, our hopes are crashing<br />
and burned like one of those dead<br />
dots, again, but we are also one of<br />
the dead dots, again, just in the<br />
other side of galaxy you don’t see<br />
<br />
v.<br />
:: feast<br />
my name is toothpick<br />
but nobody picks me before<br />
dinner or in the middle of dinner<br />
or after dinner; whenever<br /></p>

          <div><p><strong>Purge #1</strong><br />
<br />
The rain wrote <br />
rhythms on your<br />
bathroom window,<br />
begged, let<br />
me in, but<br />
it could never<br />
cleanse you<br />
like the sound<br />
of the toilet<br />
flushing<br />
your 550 calorie<br />
dinner.<br />
<br />
<strong>Purge #2</strong><br />
<br />
Your neck nearly snapped<br />
when you whipped your head back<br />
toward me, fingers<br />
still pressed<br />
against the toilet.<br />
<br />
<strong>Crumb</strong><br />
<br />
If I eat less they’ll love me If I eat less they’ll think I’m beautiful If I eat less they’ll stop staring at my plate My stomach My sausage-link fingers And maple syrup-sweat stained armpits Stop staring at me like split-pea soup spills out of my mouth each and every time I try to talk Expecting me to cry and cry and cry and cry and cry and thank them as they tell me they’re worried about me Eating my food Their food Everybody’s God damn food If I eat less they’ll love me If I eat less they’ll think I’m beautiful If I eat less they’ll win then I’ll look like them I don’t want to look like them I want to look like me If I eat less they’ll flick flick flick me off the table I’ll eat less until I’m nothing but a crumb<br />
<br />
<strong>Ukulele</strong><br />
<br />
Luke gave me his mom’s Newports.<br />
She hid them in the bathroom, buried<br /> 
beneath body towels because<br />
she lied—told her family she quit<br />
after surviving Breast Cancer.<br />
<br />
I took them to school with me,<br />
zipped up in the front pocket<br />
of my backpack.<br />
<br />
I sold them to the alley kids<br />
for a dollar a smoke because<br />
they needed something<br />
to look forward to, and<br />
I needed money<br />
to buy a ukulele.<br /></p>
