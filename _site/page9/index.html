dreams of water rushing in / the awareness<br />
                    of my body governed by gravity<br />
            &amp; the recollection that<br />
                        heavy things are made to sink.<br />
what choices remain? a woman screams &amp;<br />
        a chandelier crashes—<br />
                            a dark shadow spreads across the floor.</p>

          <div><p>The way you stack this music<br />
voice atop voice<br />
you lean to<br />
inhale how rhythms breathe<br />
and cause the body&rsquo;s bounce to<br />
accumulate effort. Nothing<br />
sleeps here: light births itself<br />
&mdash;light is a misery that folds<br />
hours into absence. You run,<br />
the music follows, voice and<br />
further voice misleading the<br />
body: if you close your eyes<br />
to imagine a moment of<br />
prayer, rest, this day<br />
will become light creasing<br />
your purpose, setting the<br />
skin aflame.</p>

and drawing houses made out of q tips<br />

I did really well in AP biology<br />
I just wanted you to know<br />
<br />
that when I picture your insides<br />
I am viewing them anatomically<br />
correct<br />
<br />
I have a tendency to exaggerate<br />
or at least thats what<br />
my mom has told me<br />
<br />
she taught me how to fold fitted sheets<br />
and how to alter my voice<br />
when making professional phone calls<br />
but that part she did indirectly<br />
<br />
I am a good listener<br />
I promise<br />
<br />
I know that there are ways to feel good<br />
<br />
I never learned how to do a cartwheel</p>

Chicago is weird<br />
outside the library<br />
a man offers me<br />
coffee nuts<br />
I am polite<br />
so I say no<br /><br />
tonight<br />
went on a date<br />
with a guy who<br />
looks like James Franco<br />
we bring up the B word<br />
binge<br />
let’s go<br /><br />
a different<br />
date tells me<br />
he found the<br />
slasher films<br />
I was in in college<br />
I panic<br />
he smiles<br /><br />
here, a story:<br />
a little girl’s arm<br />
bruised fingerprints<br />
from the principal<br />
in a closet<br />
I am alone<br />
it is cold<br /><br />
it is cold<br />
in Chicago<br />
but Boston has more<br />
snow<br />
my older sister sends me<br />
pictures of our home<br />
she says it is an<br />
igloo<br />
I want to be in an igloo<br />
for my future honeymoon<br /><br />
this summer I want to kayak<br />
grew up with a canoe<br />
in my backyard<br />
only ever canoed New Hampshire<br />
when visiting<br />
Uncle Eddie<br />
who wasn’t an uncle<br />
just<br />
my dad’s friend<br /><br />
snow turns me into a child<br />
on Michigan Avenue I am<br />
crying<br /><br />
I am so happy<br />
you are having<br />
a good week<br />
now tell me what you ate<br />
list it so I know</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
