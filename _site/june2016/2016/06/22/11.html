	<p>Imagining what my life might have looked like if I’d been<br />
undersexed: a junkie, perhaps, or someone who made<br />
a great deal of money. The branch is bare where the kitten<br />
once clung, its eyes telling me to hang in there. Or was it<br />
me, imploring the kitten (&amp; why should I wish for the<br />
kitten to let go)? We must all hang in there together, <br />
or assuredly we will all hang in there separately. <br />
They sang about chasing the dragon, but it was just <br />
a kitten, purring in the wilderness. Where there’s smoke, there’s <br />
a dragon, &amp; where there’s kitsch, there’s a kitten. Imagining <br />
what life might have looked like if there hadn’t been nine of them.<br />
Imagining Steely Dan chasing the kitten instead,<br />
time out of mind but not, alas, out of joint. Oh, kitten:<br />
maybe you didn’t drop. Maybe you raptured straight up. <br />
Maybe you simply landed on your feet like, you know, a<br />
cat. Maybe I’m simply staring at the wrong bare branch. <br />
Undersexed isn’t the right word, but it doesn’t matter<br />
because I wasn’t, I’m not. Still, I’ll never have a mug<br />
that says World’s Greatest Dad. Or a kitten, or a cat.<br />
But I cling to the branch.  Persistance. Pass it on. Pass by. <br />
That beautiful highway shimmies in the sunbaked twilight.<br />
Behind the billboards, dragons dream, passed out atop bags <br />
of gold, snoring smog, imagining what life might have looked <br />
like if they’d chased a ball of yarn instead of the sublime. <br />
Imagining the sublime up a tree again, dammit,<br />
one more distraction, the goddamned stupid sublime. No, not <br />
imagining. Knowing. All those hours. Picking them out of<br />
a line-up. Telling them, one by one, to just hang in there. <br />
Where the air is rarefied, &amp; every branch is bare,<br />
&amp; the fireman on his ladder finds peace at last.<br /></p>
