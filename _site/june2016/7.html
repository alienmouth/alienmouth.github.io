        <h2>Zachary Evans</h2>
    	
        <p style="text-align: justify;">that night your face looked like a dozen separate windmills under construction delays due to ongoing litigation between	the city and the city's ex-wife	 &amp; i mean that in the best way
i mean 		i mean that your face  		was like a beautiful inertia held      in place by bad blood because           you know    bad blood is       still blood	     you know blood is what pulls any moment       back in   towards       itself            like        a car crash in reverse
spitting blood onto the gravel spitting blood onto your face &amp; you spitting blood back onto mine		  our love like a car crash in reverse	 from collapse to      calamity to calm
nothing here even	remotely ready 	    to detonate    i say          &amp; you say        to shut up
running a gauntlet of         wiffle ball bats &amp;    sneers at your art        from your racist uncles
dead    drunk on decisions 	&amp;   oh man 	  you look       so good       in your underwear
like 	the winner of     a game show 	        where        the grand    prize is           an orgasm
like	the loser of     a game show      where    the punishment is 	 unlimited snake wine
this connection      growing tinny in      	the corners  of the 	    evenings where we need the bodies 	of those      we    love 	     to shatter in their beds 	        to prove that 	we know       how 	to eulogize 	          too stoked             about your demons &amp; 	     too scared       to deal with    mine  	      this corrosion   in    the lining of the year
across the edge      of always in the rain   exhaled as smoke     towards the corner   the    the corner     in the rain   the city     deflating like a       lung             can't    remember when the last time was       that i could muster the           enthusiasm to act like i knew        what i was talking            about &amp;      how      sobs echo lazy      down the dark    gullet of train tunnels hey   meet me	at the corner   at the   diner    at the library   wherever     but here       	&amp;  me demanding 	penalty &amp; clemency 	    &amp;  maybe      a plane ticket depending on how the first two     are received       your     mouth like a dog    jumping over     a river &amp;  my hands like two hands 	clenching   hard  on     nothing	 much  in particular    explaining the concept
of a cemetery  to a horse      i'm not trying      to make something   important           i'm just
trying to    dig at death as       soft &amp;         deliberate as         a  surgeon    signing their name 
in stitches              at the bottom right corner             of an operation            happy birthday to what's unspoken           happy      birthday to all of us lollygagging	   our catharsis until it ruptures on the table 	     it's    so     nice             everyone    so very dead        so very soon
unlimited snake wine 		for the table		unlimited snake wine 	    for america
unlimited snake wine 		for all 		that ails you	    health benefits        include never ever having to       say goodnight or i'm sorry	        grabbing on to something inside
&amp; pulling til it breaks 		guaranteed virility 	  the sense that everyone hates     you   but      finally     knowing  why      learning karate      burning the blight      out     your brain
becoming a conspiracy theory	    bursting with with fragile light	       butterfly      teeth         
defusing   the bomb of miracle        rolling slowly    to a stop 	   at the foot 	   of the stairs
do you think 	you could   spot me 	  some cash 	   i don't 	get paid        til friday</p>
