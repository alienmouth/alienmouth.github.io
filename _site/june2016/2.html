	<p>I bought pepper spray yesterday cause it was $10<br />
&amp; bedazzled. It’s still in the box on the kitchen<br />
table. When I met Adam I was wearing a<br />
halo cause it was Halloween. I gave it to him cause<br />
he was turning 22 at midnight and also<br />
probably I fell in love or maybe out of the sky<br />
or both. We had so many sleepovers. We ordered<br />
so much Chinese food. We were so sad about<br />
money. Kelsey was followed home twice &amp;<br />
that was when I liked her so I was really empathetic.<br />
She has a knife with a cat on it even though<br />
she’s more of a dog person.  I have bedazzled<br />
pepper spray recommended by Cosmo<br />
in a plastic box on my kitchen table even though<br />
I’m more of a person who’s scared all the time.<br /></p>
