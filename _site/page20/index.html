          <div><p>marijuana was legal/ the park behind the bamboo trees was home to inbred flowers/ that is where you licked both of my hands/ tied my bangin’ hair to a semi-drunk spaniel, “it’s ok, the dog is asleep.” you said/ it was a lie &amp; it’s always a lie, such a fucking lie/

your lie became animated with eye pupils/green &amp; mushy/ my hair started to take flight/”glup! slurp!”/the drunk spaniel had chewed the helium leaking like a pissy thong/from me/from the bamboo lips/there was no stopping/&amp; ears that smelled like clam chowder on my breath/ we floated up, up &amp; you waved my fallen shoe at me in a cursed goodbye/the dog barked/ bended his paws through wax paper clouds, chasing the glitter holes that were blinding us &amp; everywhere/it was china town emergency/ the cops/fried slug broth in sugar bowls/in mouth/&amp; the cops kept torching the night sky/ throwing soup cans with rolled up requests for me &amp; spaniel to land on earth, but I had just begun to eat marshmallows with zero calories, ya know? ya feel? &amp; spaniel agreed, so I took the requests &amp; put the roll-ups between the holes/ the night sky lit up, so lilted, so like a dirty skirt in a splooge fire/ the last thing I saw was your face, turning color &amp; punching air with your mega bushy groin, so you can have a little taste of the magic bamboo shoots/ the starlight spewed ashes from my lungs.

you still ask me about that night/not together but ours/first date/first hand sex we winged every time you go down on me, what a royal piss it was. but now, like today in this maybe rented apartment/it’s a blank dear, oh dear, fo sho.

          <div><p>You are sitting in bed<br />
sweating out a chicken <br />
noodle soup. You watch <br />
from afar.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Teng and Cruz live in a paint speckled<br />
apartment. Teng is dotting the ceiling <br />
and the walls with her skinny pale fingers.<br /><br /></p>

<p>She is poking craters into<br />
the moon at night. She is<br />
sending men to their deaths<br />
with holes in their skulls by doing wet <br />
willies in their temples, execution style.<br /><br /></p>

<p>They have gentrified the yuppies.<br />
Cruz has brought the soul back<br />
to the streets. Teng has blown<br />
up all of the art museums.<br /><br /></p>

<p><i>Such tackiness. Silly ang moh.<br />
Damned gringos. White flight.<br />
New Harlem Renaissance.</i><br /><br /></p>

<p>But sometimes they are tender<br />
and they lead the yuppies into <br />
coffee shops and buy them muffins.<br /><br /></p>

<p>You watch them dancing and laughing, <br />
you have a pair of binoculars. You<br />
are their peeping tom.  <br /><br /></p>

<p>You are also Pork Bun’s baby sitter.<br />
Sometimes they call you whenever<br />
it’s time for them to sing at the<br />
Yum Cha club. <br /><br /></p>

<p>In the afternoon you hear them<br />
echoing, eres para mí, Nǐ hé wǒ,<br />
always, always, always.<br /><br /></p>

<p>You know who they are. You watched <br />
Teng and Cruz, hand in hand, in loving<br />
 embrace, almost forming their own cocoon,<br />
 crash into Mother Earth as a meteor <br />
on the Lunar Year.  They woke with <br />
their lips connected.<br /><br /></p>

<p><i>Sweetness exchanged, mi amor.<br />
No pendejas shall steal you.</i><br /><br /></p>

<p>It was a cold night, you figured <br />
you had too much eggnog, despite<br />
that it wasn’t Christmas anymore. <br />
But they were so beautiful. You <br />
couldn’t your get eyes off of them. <br /><br /></p>

<p>So much so that when<br />
 they were looking for a<br />
 caretaker for their daughter,<br />
Pork Bun, you were the first<br />
email in their inbox.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Your cover letter looked <br />
like this:<i>I can cook a meen<br />
meel, I can speak conversational<br />
Spanish, I was once a yoga instructor.</i><br /><br /></p>

<p>You couldn’t spell or split<br />
your lips to form coherent<br />
sentences. And yet, they<br />
hired you. <i>Silly Ang moh<br />
wants to be our friend.</i></p>

          <br><span class="smaller">by Luis Neer on September 30, 2015</span>  <br/>
          <div><p><b>Scattered Ashes</b></p>

<p>Most of my life is a game of racquetball<br />
(I can’t like any of myself).<br /><br /></p>

<p>This poem is a translation<br />
from the jar of tears I never cried <br />
after watching The Elephant Man <br />
and gasping, seeing that John Merrick’s left hand <br />
was the only part of his body that was not disfigured, <br />
and thinking that its calmness was spreading <br />
across his body <br />
to make him radiate beauty.<br /><br /></p>

<p>I thought there was a poem to be found there, <br />
but something didn’t quite fit.<br /><br /></p>

<p>I wanted to relate it to my own self <br />
but I could not locate my own unscathed left hand.<br /><br /></p>

<p>My actual left hand bears a small white scar <br />
from where I accidentally lacerated the tissue <br />
when I was eight years old at my younger sister’s <br />
birthday party; I was trying to make a mask <br />
out of a weird kind of camouflage party hat<br />
(the world writes its own poems).<br /><br /></p>

<p>I am more like a fish <br />
in a glass bowl <br />
that is rolling down the side of a mountain <br /><br /></p>

<p>and the bowl shows my reflection <br />
and the bowl never breaks.<br /><br /></p>

<p>You told me that all my attributes<br />
are more than just a fortress<br />
to surround something rotten<br /><br /></p>

<p>but you are speaking to a wall<br /><br /></p>

<p>and I am standing <br />
behind it.</p>

<p><b>Motion Sickness</b><br />
<i>after Conor Oberst</i></p>

<p>Life is not a room<br />
People don’t just enter<br />
through some door<br />
drop odd objects and disappear<br />
Everything including you<br />
is in constant motion<br />
The first time I died<br />
my failed red heart had to choose<br />
just one way to paint my body<br />
I could have been a ballerina<br />
spinning frantic, toppling over<br />
into stupor<br />
I could have been a trembling hand<br />
I became a peeling wall<br />
a black hole<br />
a beacon of loneliness<br />
became abstract fire<br />
to warn rooms of people<br />
avert, avert your eyes<br />
I radiate nothing, save for<br />
this pale beam of doubt<br />
please don’t watch my light<br />
that smacks the floor and shatters<br />
I am searching for a place to feel solid<br />
standing still before the thunderstorm<br />
this planet holding its breath<br />
getting dragged around the Sun<br /></p>
