            <p class = "ts" ><b>Harlem Ang Moh by Maria Ng</b></p>
            You are sitting in bed</br>
            sweating out a chicken </br>
            noodle soup. You watch </br>
            from afar.</br></br>

            Teng and Cruz live in a paint speckled</br>
            apartment. Teng is dotting the ceiling </br>
            and the walls with her skinny pale fingers.</br></br>

            She is poking craters into</br>
            the moon at night. She is</br>
            sending men to their deaths</br>
            with holes in their skulls by doing wet </br>
            willies in their temples, execution style.</br></br>

            They have gentrified the yuppies.</br>
            Cruz has brought the soul back</br>
            to the streets. Teng has blown</br>
            up all of the art museums.</br></br>

            <i>Such tackiness. Silly ang moh.</br>
            Damned gringos. White flight.</br>
            New Harlem Renaissance.</i></br></br>

            But sometimes they are tender</br>
            and they lead the yuppies into </br>
            coffee shops and buy them muffins.</br></br>

            You watch them dancing and laughing, </br>
            you have a pair of binoculars. You</br>
            are their peeping tom.  </br></br>

            You are also Pork Bun's baby sitter.</br>
            Sometimes they call you whenever</br>
            it's time for them to sing at the</br>
            Yum Cha club. </br></br>

            In the afternoon you hear them</br>
            echoing, eres para mí, Nǐ hé wǒ,</br>
            always, always, always.</br></br>

            You know who they are. You watched </br>
            Teng and Cruz, hand in hand, in loving</br>
             embrace, almost forming their own cocoon,</br>
             crash into Mother Earth as a meteor </br>
            on the Lunar Year.  They woke with </br>
            their lips connected.</br></br>

            <i>Sweetness exchanged, mi amor.</br>
            No pendejas shall steal you.</i></br></br>

            It was a cold night, you figured </br>
            you had too much eggnog, despite</br>
            that it wasn't Christmas anymore. </br>
            But they were so beautiful. You </br>
            couldn't your get eyes off of them. </br></br>

            So much so that when</br>
             they were looking for a</br>
             caretaker for their daughter,</br>
            Pork Bun, you were the first</br>
            email in their inbox.</br></br>

            Your cover letter looked </br>
            like this:<i>I can cook a meen</br>
            meel, I can speak conversational</br>
            Spanish, I was once a yoga instructor.</i></br></br>

            You couldn't spell or split</br>
            your lips to form coherent</br>
            sentences. And yet, they</br>
            hired you. <i>Silly Ang moh</br>
            wants to be our friend.</i></br>
