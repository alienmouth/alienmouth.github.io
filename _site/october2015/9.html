        <h2>Nooks Krannie</h2>
    	
        <p>marijuana was legal/ the park behind the bamboo trees was home to inbred flowers/ that is where you licked both of my hands/ tied my bangin’ hair to a semi-drunk spaniel, “it’s ok, the dog is asleep.” you said/ it was a lie &amp; it’s always a lie, such a fucking lie/

your lie became animated with eye pupils/green &amp; mushy/ my hair started to take flight/”glup! slurp!”/the drunk spaniel had chewed the helium leaking like a pissy thong/from me/from the bamboo lips/there was no stopping/&amp; ears that smelled like clam chowder on my breath/ we floated up, up &amp; you waved my fallen shoe at me in a cursed goodbye/the dog barked/ bended his paws through wax paper clouds, chasing the glitter holes that were blinding us &amp; everywhere/it was china town emergency/ the cops/fried slug broth in sugar bowls/in mouth/&amp; the cops kept torching the night sky/ throwing soup cans with rolled up requests for me &amp; spaniel to land on earth, but I had just begun to eat marshmallows with zero calories, ya know? ya feel? &amp; spaniel agreed, so I took the requests &amp; put the roll-ups between the holes/ the night sky lit up, so lilted, so like a dirty skirt in a splooge fire/ the last thing I saw was your face, turning color &amp; punching air with your mega bushy groin, so you can have a little taste of the magic bamboo shoots/ the starlight spewed ashes from my lungs.

you still ask me about that night/not together but ours/first date/first hand sex we winged every time you go down on me, what a royal piss it was. but now, like today in this maybe rented apartment/it’s a blank dear, oh dear, fo sho.
