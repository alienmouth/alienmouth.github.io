          <div><p>Imagining what my life might have looked like if I’d been<br />
undersexed: a junkie, perhaps, or someone who made<br />
a great deal of money. The branch is bare where the kitten<br />
once clung, its eyes telling me to hang in there. Or was it<br />
me, imploring the kitten (&amp; why should I wish for the<br />
kitten to let go)? We must all hang in there together, <br />
or assuredly we will all hang in there separately. <br />
They sang about chasing the dragon, but it was just <br />
a kitten, purring in the wilderness. Where there’s smoke, there’s <br />
a dragon, &amp; where there’s kitsch, there’s a kitten. Imagining <br />
what life might have looked like if there hadn’t been nine of them.<br />
Imagining Steely Dan chasing the kitten instead,<br />
time out of mind but not, alas, out of joint. Oh, kitten:<br />
maybe you didn’t drop. Maybe you raptured straight up. <br />
Maybe you simply landed on your feet like, you know, a<br />
cat. Maybe I’m simply staring at the wrong bare branch. <br />
Undersexed isn’t the right word, but it doesn’t matter<br />
because I wasn’t, I’m not. Still, I’ll never have a mug<br />
that says World’s Greatest Dad. Or a kitten, or a cat.<br />
But I cling to the branch.  Persistance. Pass it on. Pass by. <br />
That beautiful highway shimmies in the sunbaked twilight.<br />
Behind the billboards, dragons dream, passed out atop bags <br />
of gold, snoring smog, imagining what life might have looked <br />
like if they’d chased a ball of yarn instead of the sublime. <br />
Imagining the sublime up a tree again, dammit,<br />
one more distraction, the goddamned stupid sublime. No, not <br />
imagining. Knowing. All those hours. Picking them out of<br />
a line-up. Telling them, one by one, to just hang in there. <br />
Where the air is rarefied, &amp; every branch is bare,<br />
&amp; the fireman on his ladder finds peace at last.<br /></p>

          <div><p><strong>Housekeeping</strong><br />
<br />
Throw your baseball cap<br />
in the dishwasher.   (This<br />
could be your son.)   Use <br />
diminutive language.   Clean<br />
the kitchen, try to get<br />
high.   Remember:   you are fascinated<br />
by repetition.   (you are<br />
a human being.<br />
              A letter comes<br />
to “DAD” from Richmond.   For fear<br />
of Federales, do not open.   It’s probably<br />
an acronym.   Instead, buy expensive<br />
underpants.   Knit a knit suitcase<br />
reinforced with discarded three-<br />
ring binders.   Swallow everything.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Explication</strong><br />
<br />
I am behind you <br />
in the stairwell<br />
explaining my <br />
absence, that I had<br />
purchased a book<br />
and would accept <br />
two more.   I appreciate <br />
value.   I will buy<br />
two toothpaste tubes <br />
for the price of one-<br />
and-a-half.   I am <br />
a happy American.<br />
I am fit enough <br />
to enjoy a little<br />
snacking.   I have <br />
a girlfriend.   I have<br />
a twelve-speed bike.<br />
My girlfriend<br />
is a twelve-speed bike.<br />
I was androgynous as a ten-<br />
year-old; I had long,<br />
beautiful eyelashes <br />
and red red lips.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Dear,</strong><br />
<br />
all of these salted<br />
crackers represent<br />
love.   jangling keys<br />
stand for consumerism<br />
and self concept:<br />
catalytic, you leave me<br />
without nexus— excited<br />
particles conform to skin<br />
of a balloon giraffe,<br />
an emptied mayonnaise jar<br />
<br />
the physical aspect of matter<br />
is a kind of honorific assigned<br />
to colliding energies— particles<br />
of space connecting space<br />
so when my sleeves give way to elbows<br />
whatever’s really going on<br />
has as much to do with being still<br />
as a swinging lamp,<br />
bleeding lotus flowers<br />
and rose-red wine.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>[How to un-do things:]</strong><br />
<br />
How to un-do things:<br />
Cut directly through<br />
the center—peel the subject’s<br />
skin, fit to something more<br />
deserving.   We are<br />
all divine, perfect images<br />
of a vengeful schizoid—<br />
There is nothing more<br />
frustrating than waiting<br />
in line at the Post Office,<br />
and little halves of books<br />
are kind and unassuming.<br />
The best customer <br />
is a repeat customer.<br />
For these many years<br />
rain’s been falling sulfur<br />
dioxide and various mono<br />
nitrogen-oxide hammers.<br />
I billow through the troposphere<br />
collecting notes for maps.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>My Body</strong><br />
<br />
Parts of me are falling off<br />
and acting like they know what’s going on.<br />
An expression of my recessive genes<br />
has appointments in two different cities,<br />
each accessible by greyhound.<br />
My nose inchworms across the carpet,<br />
encouraging comprehensive empathy<br />
for other selves I’ve met.   Not that I need<br />
reminders, really, it’s just there are<br />
so many parts. My nasopharynx wants<br />
to eat Korean noodles—the rest<br />
disagree.   I’m glad you seem to understand;<br />
I want someone who seems<br />
     to understand.<br /></p>

Street, that apartment <br />
with carbon dioxide sneaking in <br />
with the heat, <br />
filling rooms in a drowsy fog  </p>

<p>the street lights buzzing clementines <br />
above the neighbor who has fallen <br />
drunkenly in the street <br />
and a band <br />
of angry rescuers<br />
Yell and drag at him  <br />
in the confusion   </p>

<p>half a dream, I was resigned to  <br />

A dash of freckled sun <br />

<p>i remember anne<br />
mostly as a voice<br />
on the phone or <br />
a body curled over<br />
the kitchen counter<br />
crying at the end<br />
of something i was<br />
too young to understand</p>

<p>it turns out she died<br />
4 years ago<br />
somewhere in nevada</p>

<p>i didnít even know <br />
she’d moved</p>

<p>poets and outlaws as <br />
sparkling fuses between<br />
the beating of wings<br />
and the blinking of<br />
buzzards in a desert<br />
no oneís bothered to name</p>

<p>and later, pieces of harold<br />
lloydís hand in the<br />
prop bucket</p>

<p>and youíll never have to work again.</p>

left eye on the<br />
clearance rack in<br />
the curiosity shop<br />

they pay for themselves</p>

<p>and he walks out into<br />
the world w/ a new found<br />

<p>the squealing of tires<br />
