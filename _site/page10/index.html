<br />
I did really well in AP biology<br />
I just wanted you to know<br />
<br />
that when I picture your insides<br />
I am viewing them anatomically<br />
correct<br />
<br />
I have a tendency to exaggerate<br />
or at least thats what<br />
my mom has told me<br />
<br />
she taught me how to fold fitted sheets<br />
and how to alter my voice<br />
when making professional phone calls<br />
but that part she did indirectly<br />
<br />
I am a good listener<br />
I promise<br />
<br />
I know that there are ways to feel good<br />

I never learned how to do a cartwheel</p>

Chicago is weird<br />
outside the library<br />
a man offers me<br />
coffee nuts<br />
I am polite<br />
so I say no<br /><br />
tonight<br />
went on a date<br />
with a guy who<br />
looks like James Franco<br />
we bring up the B word<br />
binge<br />
let’s go<br /><br />
a different<br />
date tells me<br />
he found the<br />
slasher films<br />
I was in in college<br />
I panic<br />
he smiles<br /><br />
here, a story:<br />
a little girl’s arm<br />
bruised fingerprints<br />
from the principal<br />
in a closet<br />
I am alone<br />
it is cold<br /><br />
it is cold<br />
in Chicago<br />
but Boston has more<br />
snow<br />
my older sister sends me<br />
pictures of our home<br />
she says it is an<br />
igloo<br />
I want to be in an igloo<br />
for my future honeymoon<br /><br />
this summer I want to kayak<br />
grew up with a canoe<br />
in my backyard<br />
only ever canoed New Hampshire<br />

Uncle Eddie<br />
who wasn’t an uncle<br />

my dad’s friend<br /><br />
snow turns me into a child<br />
on Michigan Avenue I am<br />

I am so happy<br />
you are having<br />
a good week<br />
now tell me what you ate<br />
list it so I know</p>

          <div><p><b>dear hairless chelsea,</b><br /><br />
Two women are building a house<br />
around a dying animal.<br />
They go to the river<br />
&amp; dig up clay<br />
to make into bricks<br />
they bake in an oven.<br /><br />

The bricks stack up high.<br />
Four, five deep.<br />
The walls are thick.<br />
They leave space for a window.<br />
They leave space for a door.<br /><br />

They finish the house<br />
&amp; the animal says<br />
thank you so much<br />
but I am still dying.<br /><br />

Love,<br />
Sara</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>

<p><b>dear hairless hairless tiny teacup pig playing a piano,</b><br /><br />
Your song gives me chills.<br />
&amp; the piano you've got sounds<br />
just like the feeling I had riding<br />
the train into this bright city<br />
for the first time &amp; so often since.<br />
Where did you get your piano?<br />
Because the notes all remind me<br />
of people I know, people I knew,<br />
&amp; of these beautiful intersecting lines<br />
they draw across my field of vision,<br />
these single words that I don't<br />
know the meanings of, but know<br />
the feelings of, &amp; how they move<br />
with me when I turn my head<br />
or walk down the street or kiss<br />
a person other than the one<br />
I wish I was kissing.<br /><br />

Hairless, it feels like you<br />
are putting your whole hands<br />
in my wounds.<br />
It feels like a dream<br />
about your family<br />
where everyone dies.<br />
One you can't stop having,<br />
that strangers quote<br />
at you on the street,<br />
that is projected<br />
on the wall<br />
in your favorite<br />
restaurant.<br /><br />

Pig, can we stop now?<br />
I love your song, it's true,<br />
I can't stop looking at it,<br />
but I am tired of feeling for now.<br />
Let's sleep quietly on our stomachs<br />
&amp; hope everything's changed<br />
by the time we wake up.<br /><br />

Love always,<br />
Sara</p>
<p>&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

          <div><p><b>Everyone Wanted a Bicycle</b><br /><br />
<p>The gelatinous boulder, blue-skinned, grows beyond the blades of the playground.<br />
Homeowners continue their calls. They press fingers into screens a bit more forcefully.</p><br /><br />
<p><b>Bus Ride Somewhere</b><br /><br />
<p>An ear bud turns into a miner inside my ear.<br />
He is drinking water from a canteen, talking to someone on a cell.<br />
I can feel his head getting sweaty. His voice is raspy.<br /><br />
The interior loosens and something gold appears.<br />
The gold shakes like an agitated tiger <br />
and the miner swings his axe, cracking the gold in two.<br /><br />
He eats both pieces; the chewing echoes<br />
until the lonesome feast concludes. Then he immolates.<br />
He slams his fiery hands into the floor of my ear<br />
and screams; I cannot look anywhere.<br /><br />
Jerking violently, he becomes a miniature sun<br />
and flows freely through my body as if I were a ghost.<br /><br />
And sitting wherever he wants in me, sensing my weaknesses, he projects<br />
from his ten thousand flaming mouths an afternoon<br />
in which I am completely stupid and what-the-fuck about everything.</p>
