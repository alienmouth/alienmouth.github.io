          <br><span class="smaller">by Kate Monica on March 19, 2016</span>  <br/>
          <div><p><b>Fun War</b><br /><br />
she says ‘you are officially the first thing<br />
i think of,’ her mouth a line, as if<br />
i am condemned. i am so okay<br /><br />

with that. what was i just gonna say. a girl<br />
at my summer camp went to an alternative high school <br />
and wore tank tops because she wasnt worried about anybody seeing<br /><br />

rain speckles your face all silver when you tell me <br />
we both missed the deadline <br />
for the internship application. i think that it will be okay<br /><br />

but i am always wrong. a fortune teller gleans <br />
out of a glass orb<br />
a future you disagree with. <br />
i dont have to know what happens to know<br /><br />

i disagree with the traffic light on a night <br />
she and i are in the backseat<br />
together, both internally warring over whether or not <br />
to place a hand<br />
you said it’s not too late for me but to be careful<br />
i said ‘with what’<br />
you said ‘be careful’ <br />
&amp; my brain turned <br />
to a claw clasping &amp; unclasping <br />
until you texted back with more clarity <br /><br />

i don’t think i feel like it<br />

i want her to think i am a whimsical person<br />
but i don’t have any posters in my room right now and it resembles an asylum<br /><br />

i think, i don’t know<br />
i’ve never seen one from the inside<br />
next time she comes over<br />
i will tell her that</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>

<p><b>It Is In Everyone’s Best Interest</b><br /><br />

i liked her instantly because she had a picture of her mom as her profile picture<br />
there are only erratic ways to measure tenderness &amp; i think that’s how<br />
it should feel when someone is bashful in an honest way, not just<br />
because it’s cute and fun to draw people<br />
closer to the person they would be if no one had ever said anything<br />
when you are in the room i feel it in my back teeth as a kind of metallic ringing, <br />
chewing on the aluminum of you saying hi to other people first <br />
it is impossible not to fall in love with someone when they tell you the story<br />
of the afternoon they stood in their backyard looking small above<br />
the acorns littering the lawn, moving again and again<br />
the hair from their face<br />
it is impossible not to fall in love<br />
at one point or another, but you have to try not to<br />
ruin your perception of each other in this way; i idealize girls into gods<br /><br />

and feel betrayed when they can’t enact a flood whenever i want &amp; <br />
boys and girls do this to me &amp; boys and girls do this to each other &amp; boys<br />
&amp; boys pull at each other to see who makes more of a predator &amp; girls<br />
&amp; girls pull at each other to see if anyone really loves anyone for the inside<br />
i click through her profile pictures and wish we could be friends but<br />
there are only insolent ways to distract yourself, or i always<br />
feel so kind from a distance</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>

<p><b>Whenever Someone Asks If I’ve Been Skinny Dipping I Say Yes But I Haven’t</b><br /><br />
depending on how far you zoom out it is easier to absorb any sized tragedy<br />
i havent watched the news in two months<br />
you cant make me <br /><br />

i have enough to fear &amp; tread above<br />
not frantic, just moving<br />
so as to avoid touching the awful slimy thing w/ my foot<br />
or whatever else is at the bottom of a lake so big<br /><br />

it’s been a while since i’ve seen you and you were not happy to see me<br />
i’m not mad, i know you’ve been busy organizing your future by color<br />
it’s just another thing to notice<br />
get my head wet last, wait til everyone else goes first<br />
but generally someone has to dunk me, two open hands <br />
on my shoulders &amp; laughter that blurs once underwater <br /><br />

longer i hold my breath down here the more<br />
my lungs fill with steel, cold tug &amp; shrapnel<br />
you sent me a series of snapchats of you at ArtSpace in Hartford<br />
i am uncultured and didn’t understand what i was looking at <br />
but i liked the exhibit with all the red bowls<br />
full of red flowers</p>

          <br><span class="smaller">by Jim Walls on March 19, 2016</span>  <br/>
          <div><p>I didn’t tell you that it had nothing to do with you although I did do it because I knew I could stay in your bed in Tokyo. I didn’t tell you that it took 8 days for my family to figure out I wasn’t in America anymore.<br /><br />

You didn’t know all the reasons why I flew across the ocean so far that it became a different day. You didn’t know why I got fired from my job or why I used all my savings to buy a round trip ticket and that I didn’t plan on going home. You didn’t know that I wasn’t on vacation.<br /><br />

We spent a lot of time watching movies on your laptop on your bed with your cat. Most of the time we were talking more than watching. I suggested that we buy tickets to this place I had read about on the internet called the Suicide Forest. I said:<br /><br />

“Not to do it together. Just to see it.”<br /><br />

So we bought tickets for at the end of September. At the beginning of September I ran out of money but I cancelled my return flight anyway. And on the night my flight left without me I got into bed naked with you and you took off your clothes too. The day after that we started fighting. You later admitted you felt hurt about reproached advances when you told me:<br /><br />

“You think you’re above the law of the way things work.”<br /><br />

You resented funding what you saw as my vacation but you continued to pay for my food and alcohol and cigarettes and share half of your bed with me even though we never fucked again after the first time. But we still slept naked and I still watched you get dressed every morning. I later claimed I was only drunk when I yelled:<br /><br />

“Everyone hates me because I can’t love them.”<br /><br />

And it started to become clear that we wouldn’t make it to the Suicide Forest together. I started going out at night and waking up on the sidewalk. You started planning a backpacking trip through southeast Asia. The idea of you traveling for a month alone through third world countries seemed unlikely to me. I said:<br /><br />

“You won’t be able to talk to anyone for a month.”<br /><br />

And then I realized I wouldn’t either. You said:<br /><br />

“I’ve traveled abroad before. I think I got it.”<br /><br />

I hated that you used the word abroad. I said:<br /><br />

“I guess only rich people get poor countries.”<br /><br />

I didn’t believe you would actually go until I found an envelope full of yen on your bed and a note that said:<br /><br />

-Please don’t let my cat die.<br />

When I dropped the note was when I first thought about what death might be like. It could be a screen that displayed “oops over” for 5 seconds in size 12 font and then went blank forever. I imagined your body covered in rat-sized bugs as it floated down a river in the Cambodian jungle and then:<br /><br />

-Oops over.<br /><br />

And when I saw people in the street who I could never talk to because they didn’t speak my language and I didn’t speak theirs I thought to myself:<br /><br />

-Oops over.<br /><br />

I wished I had the power to see inside them instead of the power to imagine them dead. And then I thought:<br /><br />

-There’s too many people in this world.<br /><br />

That was the thought that made me drop the cigarette that burned the little crater in your cat’s ear. Her eyes reflected back at me with a yowl when I tried to reach under the bed to pet her. She couldn’t understand the concepts of accident, apology, regret. So I let her outside and she never came back.<br /><br />

When my sister found out I was in Japan she had sent me an email. Part of it said:<br /><br />

-Cutting out the things that you think are making you unhappy won’t make you happier but I guess you’re getting closer to the problem.<br /><br />

I read this again while on the bus to the Suicide Forest. The weather was gray and on the horizon I saw 2 dark slopes rising to meet each other before getting lost in the clouds. I thought it might be the base of Mt. Fuji but I had never seen a mountain before so I couldn’t believe that it could be that big and I tried to email my sister:<br /><br />

-Tell dad I’m ok.<br /><br />

But my phone died and behind my eyelids was my name displayed in size 6 font.<br /><br />

Inside the Suicide Forest was all green moss coating everything and when I went in far enough I could barely hear anything at all. I forgot to buy a ticket back to Tokyo and I didn’t even know where I was. I was inside the Suicide Forest near the base of maybe Mt. Fuji. Even when it started getting dark it seemed unlikely to me that I could get myself killed while traveling in the first world.<br /><br />

But inside my head were 3 mental images:<br /><br />

-The envelope full of yen on your bed in Tokyo.<br /><br />

-My dad’s blue truck in Delaware.<br /><br />

-You pulling on your briefs while holding a lit cigarette.<br /><br />

And these things felt like they were dissolving into a blank screen. By the time the sun rose I was still in the Suicide Forest near the base of what was probably Mt. Fuji but I felt like I was barely there at all.

          <br><span class="smaller">by Ricky Garni on March 19, 2016</span>  <br/>
          <div><p>I would like to build a movie of your life that lasted a lifetime. And this life follows another.  And that life follows this. Therefore a lifetime would be forever. I am ready to make this movie. I am ready to watch this movie. And now I will. And so I will go. I am ready. I think you will be happy. It’s time for us to enjoy the rest of our lives. For the movie to begin.  Just look at the curtains, how wonderful they are, how they open like birds at a window, dying to be outside.</p>

<p><b>I Declare</b><br /><br />

If you say I love you enough, it sounds just like a rock skipping on a frozen lake, which you would think would sound really sharp and hard, but it actually sounds just like mallard ducks looking for little fish under the ice of a frozen lake.

“I love you,” the mallard ducks say to the little fish, frozen in the lake.

          <br><span class="smaller">by Brittany Swenson on March 19, 2016</span>  <br/>
          <div><p>Doom trickles. Is it sweat? A cold perspiration? A delusion. Stabbed by realness. Blade serving as a medium. But the blade is a butter knife. Not to be taken seriously. Don’t misconstrue a few scratches for a gauging wound. Don’t let this medium belittle you. Yet here I am on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Crybaby. Not nurtured properly. My mother was 23 when she had me. She could hardly nurture herself. Much less another human being. Compassion emits. As does resentment. Eddy of fusions. Seeing the line of division. Between self and self. They’re possessed by hate. It is this division which connects them. A shot of adrenaline jets upward. Jolted to extremities. When the external resource takes hold. Curse the hold. Never asked for it consciously. Maybe unconsciously. I did. What is this insane mirage known as Here and Now? As if we were flippantly thrown, a few crumbs to the wind, God ruffles It’s coat to It’s comfort – the wind is provoking a chill of some sort. Pigeons peck at me. For I am a mound of crumbling selves. Stomp me out. For the love of God stomp me out. Crush me into complacency. Maybe then I’d be okay.</p>

<p>I give forth to these images. Oblique and indifferent. The stare of white makes me shiver. For it is through the blankness that I see. Validation of the sight. I guess that’s what this is. Thanks for the opening, there. That good ol’ clearing. Here’s a yawn for every revelatory moment. Not even tired. But I figured I’d throw in a yawn. Because why not. Encompassing attitude: ‘why not?’ Death? Why not? Birth? Why not? Pain? Why not? Confidence? Why not? Truth? Why not? Maya? Why not? The senses peer in on themselves. Leaning in on their own secrets. Huffy breaths I’d imagine. Smelly and heavy. The feel of when a secret secretes itself upon the earlobe. Another shiver. Picture that. It does make sense. In a way. Numbers are not relevant here. No tally. No markup. No error. The error is of the whole thing, I think. Miraculous error. The joy of human constructs.</p>

<p>Oh, but I am on the run. On the run. On the run. Okayness is all I long for. I’m a child of the moon. A Cancer Goddammit. Ruled by the question of security. Ruled by the need to find home. To find home in sentences. To find home in touch. To find home in friendship. Think of the emotional validity behind father’s words. Inherent self entitlement – but not in the form of narcissism. I admire him. Grew up in the streets. Plagued. These streets are still smeared with dirt. And angry faces. Fucking miserable city, New York. Romanticize the gloom. This has been home. Gloom comes natural, here. The cramped shuffling. The gray and its gallop. It shuts this bravery like a clam. I wish I could live in bed.</p>

          <br><span class="smaller">by Ron Gibson on March 18, 2016</span>  <br/>
          <div><p>As I stood on the deck of a ferry, wind against my face, slicing<br />
through dark waters under blue sky, I thought about things on the<br />
borderlands of possible and impossible, like digitally-manipulated<br />
art. You seemed to be all around me: in the giggles of children, in<br />
the conversation of lovers, in the cries of hungry seagulls, as they<br />
conducted aerial maneuvers for alms.</p>

<p>I thought about beginnings and endings, and yesterdays and nows and<br />
tomorrows, and I could feel you there, a presence just beyond the<br />
periphery. Everything shouted, but only I could hear your name in the<br />
thick throats, in the sea hiss, in the engine rumble. I heard you<br />
somewhere over the Olympic mountain range, past the mountain goats<br />
past the snowcaps; you were where the sun lays down to die, and I<br />
thought of you dreaming by its side, content, full of love and loved<br />
in full.</p>

<p>Later, in the ferry terminal, I read fictional constructs from another<br />
time, from another place, and there was a certain heat in their<br />
fictional lives that felt familiar, that felt reflective of us,<br />
without actually being us.</p>

<p>I tried to explain to myself what ‘was,’ but still could not explain<br />
what ‘is.’ It was some foreign word on the tongue without translation;<br />
a novel not yet fully conceived; it was a song yet to be heard by<br />
ears, and it was the sonic boom that filled the skies with your<br />
pounding heart, as metal spires loomed into view on the horizon,<br />
growing larger and larger with your bright welcomes, until the sight<br />
was more than any one man could take.</p>
