          <div><p>There is no way to say it. Your window is collecting webs,<br />
your blackberries ripen and swell and fall</p>

<p>for the squirrels. Every day we spend less<br />
and less time waiting. Sometimes I stand on the roof</p>

<p>and say it into the wind: the first syllable<br />
rises and drops to the ground, and the second</p>

<p>gets lost in the forest between my mind and my mouth,<br />
to be picked apart by crows, who fly away</p>

<p>crying <i>rry, rry, rry.</i> I don’t know how I got here.<br />
How I made it here without you. All I did</p>

<p>was look back when you kept looking on,<br />
stumble through the dark in some</p>

<p>backwards way, kicking mushrooms, breadcrumbs,<br />
tripping over logs and nests, reaching</p>

<p>into your absence and finding suddenly<br />
a recognizable tree, and mother, out front, looking for stars.</p>

<p>I called for you, I swear. So did she.<br />
I try to say it in the morning, sitting on your bed:</p>

<p>but the first syllable gets caught in the webs<br />
of your open window, and when the spider comes</p>

<p>she wraps it up, pauses, whispers <i>so?</i>, and eats.<br />
Every day something of yours disappears.</p>

<p>The yellow dress, the small bird painting, and<br />
one by one the books. I move through our house</p>

<p>trying to say it. <i>I am so</i>, the clock has become<br />
bored by my eyes. <i>I am so</i>, I sleep terribly. <i>I am so</i></p>

          <div><p>I bought pepper spray yesterday cause it was $10<br />
&amp; bedazzled. It’s still in the box on the kitchen<br />
table. When I met Adam I was wearing a<br />
halo cause it was Halloween. I gave it to him cause<br />
he was turning 22 at midnight and also<br />
probably I fell in love or maybe out of the sky<br />
or both. We had so many sleepovers. We ordered<br />
so much Chinese food. We were so sad about<br />
money. Kelsey was followed home twice &amp;<br />
that was when I liked her so I was really empathetic.<br />
She has a knife with a cat on it even though<br />
she’s more of a dog person.  I have bedazzled<br />
pepper spray recommended by Cosmo<br />
in a plastic box on my kitchen table even though<br />
I’m more of a person who’s scared all the time.<br /></p>

          <div><p>how long until the bad spot can be touched? I am asking for<br />
myself. here, there are so many bruises in the making. I stand<br />
up inside the orchard—little seedlings gather, apple cores, my<br />
vertebrae stuck together, like so. is it ok if I crush you? I so<br />
want to, I so love this dripping all over.<br /></p>

“Everyone loves cheese toast,” said the TV judge. The contestant was safe, again. Not on top. She seethed with anger at cheddar and bread.<br />
<br />
S01E02<br />
“Everyone loves cheese toast,” said the judge on the reality TV show. The chef beamed. It was made with spray cheese and garlic crostini.<br />
<br />
S01E03<br />
“Everyone loves cheese toast,” said the main judge from the reality show. “But what you’ve done here grating 5 cheeses was amazing. A win.”<br />
<br />
S01E04<br />
“Everyone loves cheese toast,” said the reality show judge, “Have you had a glass of water? Go grab one!” The water board paid her 100K.<br />
<br />
S01E05<br />
“Everyone loves cheese toast,” said the TV show judge, “But we’re tired of seeing it from you. Please pack your pots and pans, and go home.”</p>

we think about the things<br />
we wish someone had told us<br /></p>

<p>Back when we still had time —<br />
like, “if you want to be<br />
a monster, you can just<br /></p>

<p>Slice open your skin and step <br />
out into the welcoming shadows<br /></p>

<p>In the woods by the side of the road<br />
— hunt birds, drink insect blood<br /></p>

<p>And grow scales, and faces<br />
to lure boys to their death<br />
when they drive by <br /></p>

<p>Leaning out the window<br />
screaming things<br /></p>
