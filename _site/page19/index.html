          <div><p><b>Wigilia Dinners</b></p>
<p>A muddy patch on Greyhound windows,<br />
scraping clean in claret bath lacquer<br />
mulling heat rash ruddy amongst<br />
the stomach pain swirls inky acidic<br />
markers as testament to what gets<br />
left as unburned kindle, as untested steel,<br />
as chalkboard theory, as textbook framework.<br /><br />

Embrace of asphalt arms, the model<br />
sparkling monuments to welfare states past<br />
which guide as gilded wire to weary dawns<br />
forward in militia march of white faced<br />
hours, leaking pavement shades in buckets<br />
for trenchant timing up is the strongest<br />
suit of cardstock to have handed.<br /><br />

Plastic cups, plates of precious silver,<br />
like a mismatch of Wigilia and milk bar,<br />
wash against each as sandshore rocks<br />
the barring remove of aparting ocean;<br />
as still as life mural painting, stand<br />
up personable, but it&#39;s not the<br />
sort of supper you have until you&#39;re<br /><br />

older, able to make sense.</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><b>Ode to DLR</b></p>
<p>You and I should meet on air,<br />
in these whirling hyperloop palaces<br />
of all burnished steel, treated glass,<br />
Polish plumbers&#39; expressions of effort<br />
possessed of a breaking cold becoming<br />
strangely humble,<br /><br />

as if you could meet anyone,<br />
from anywhere,<br />
when next break light chimes.<br /><br />

You and I should make an affair,<br />
bathe in serendipitous twinkle of<br />
Alexandra Palace hill light,<br />
click heels and wish to tune<br />
of Turkish butchers&#39; instrumental clatter,<br />
seeming soundtrack of Haringey<br /><br />

as if there could be anything,<br />
all desires,<br />
in off-beat pulse of gig space walls,<br /><br />

in the grandeur spiral of 8 million<br />
we sometimes find ourselves.<br /><br />

as two points alighting the same.</p>

pyrotechnics and bodies...<br />

the point is he died,<br />
while I looked at the Internet<br />
and masturbated in my bed.<br /><br />

many deaths have occurred<br />
while i&#39;ve masturbated in my bed.<br /><br />

this reality and the eeriness<br />
of the Starbucks mermaid,<br /><br />

are more grounding than a funeral.</p>

          <br><span class="smaller">by Kendra Oakes on February 15, 2016</span>  <br/>
          <div><p>ONE</p>

<p>when i was nineteen, or eighteen or twenty, my friends and i went to this party. some party in some strange basement-in-an-alley type place. the type of place we loved, where we felt like we were somewhere doing something. there was a show, some terrible band was playing terrible music. i will never remember who. that isn&#39;t important to this story though.</p>

<p>we all got idiotically drunk. the kind of drunk you look back on and wonder how you could ever act so free.</p>

<p>so idiotically drunk we took off our shirts. all of us. so drunk and dancing. so free so loud so uncaring. i had brought one of those idiotically large bottles of wine. you know the kind, the ones that look like regular wine bottles but magnified. i thought i was tough and dramatic. maybe free. anyway, no shirts, drunk, dancing. a friend i wanted to fuck took my idiot bottle of wine and took a idiotically large drink of it. he was an alcoholic. that isn&#39;t important to this story though. we kept dancing and he kept drinking. somehow my mouth violently collided with the bottom of the bottle. not purposely, mind you. very fucking accidentally. i remember it not being my fault and i&#39;m sure he remembers it not being his. anyway, it hurt. alot. i knew i wasn&#39;t going to like what happened when i ran my tongue across my teeth. and i didn’t. a significant chunk of one of my front teeth was gone. did i swallow it? was it on the ground? i remember my third or fourth thought immediately after it happened was to wonder if someone was going to find it on the sticky floor the next day.</p>

<p>a few weeks or perhaps a month or so later my mom came to pick me up to go to her house for something, maybe for a holiday. maybe it was autumn then. i don’t remember. i remember walking out of my apartment and through the garden. filled with dread. i walked to her car and said “Hi mom” and i&#39;ve always heard of people say how they &#39;could never forget the look on his/her/their face&#39; but i&#39;d never really believed it. my memory always has been spotty. but i remember that look. the look on her face when i opened my mouth and she saw my tooth. i don&#39;t think she looked at me again the entire time she was driving us home.</p>

<p>my parents paid to have it fixed. no daughter of theirs was going to walk around looking like that. i went to the dentist i&#39;d been seeing since i was a child. she asked me how my mother was, how my brother was liking college. she even remembered what college he was going to. he has always been a patient of hers as well. my whole family had been. she asked me how it had happened. i tried to make it sound casual “Well my friend accidentally hit me in the face with a giant bottle of wine ha ha.” it did not come off casual or ha ha. i don&#39;t think she talked the entire time she was making my teeth symmetrical again.</p>

<p>this happened four, or five or three, years ago. my teeth still look symmetrical and you can&#39;t tell one is half fake unless you examine them closely. i forget it ever happened most of the time. the only times i remember is on first dates when i use it as a conversation piece, or when i want to eat an apple. i&#39;m scared that if i bite into an apple my fake tooth bit will pop right off.</p>

<p>TWO</p>

<p>for three weeks straight i would wake up from dreams of my teeth crumbling in my mouth. the dreams would begin in a medley of scenarios, they never seemed specific enough to be worth remembering. then it would be the same, every time. i would run my tongue across my teeth and they wouldn&#39;t hold still, they would wiggle and feel frightening. i would then look in a mirror and bare my teeth to myself they would be unhappy shades of brown. sickly ambers and the muds of three-days-ago rains. horrified i would reach up to touch them. my fingers would meet bone and the teeth would just crumble crumble crumble at the slightest touch it looked like a roman ruin panic would overtake me as my mouth turned into the grounds of the parthenon.</p>

<p>when i wake i feel my teeth one by one, touching each as counting my eggs in my nest. not being able to avoid feeling as if athena was disappointed in me.</p>

<p>THREE</p>

<p>googling the family tree of zeus on a saturday night to find what goddess i could pretend to be that week. it hurt my head to read all the names and murders of such a tortured family.</p>

          <div><p><b>who&#39;s to tell</b><br /><br />
<p>don&#39;t concern yourself w/ why i fall<br />
silent in the dime store dressing room<br /><br />

i&#39;m simply considering what the cops<br />
could tell about me from my corpse alone:<br /><br />

twenty-something / female / nailbiter<br />
a ham in the bedroom (groomed pubic hair)<br /><br />

poor circulation / chronic disease / purple knees<br />
eats amitriptyline, cyclobenzaprine, daily b.c.<br /><br />

forever not ready for... next of kin? forget it<br />
just a long procession of indiscretions<br /><br />

one after another, who&#39;s to tell whether<br />
she fell in love too easily or not at all?<br /><br />

subliminal scars traverse wrists, shins<br />
chief inspector thinks stigmata, then chokes<br /><br />

back his unchewed dogmatism, spewing out<br />
baptismal-like onto the parking lot, rinsing away<br /><br />

all forensic evidence of foul play or wtf<br />
i was last seen trying to say, <i>choke me</i><br /><br />

only long enough to make the ceiling blur<br />
to make the mad forget their self-inflicted<br /><br />

sores, deep inside the drawstring pockets<br />
of the body left to rot outside your door</p><br /><br />

<p><b>fucked up firsts</b><br /><br />

out of my whole palaceful of taxidermied teenage boys<br />
you’re my favorite, pissing eternally on the rubber moon<br />
perhaps we never rly landed on the perfect NASA snap-<br />
shot of the kennedy assassin i&#39;m down here wearing as a hat<br />
as if it&#39;s just another tourist trap inside my dirty film debut<br />
there&#39;s no one actually inside me but a b&amp;w tequila worm<br />
they green-screen the erection in later, pin the tail on the <br />
imaginary friend, play <i>pretend we were each other’s fucked<br />
up firsts</i>, redeeming the worst virgin daze of our lives<br />
thinking sex on the beach wouldn&#39;t hammer sand straight<br />
through my hourglass physique- yes, i see this year <br />
it&#39;s chic to misremember, tremor, have too much to drink<br />
but in the long run who will recreate, cosplay the deadbeat <br />
dungeon master w/ his feet up on the back of daddy&#39;s seat?</p><br /><br />

<p><b>alphabentitus</b><br /><br />
psycho junkyard varmints got me magically bat-shit bankrupt by meat-juice o&#39;clock<br />
like fuck there&#39;s nothing left but our asbestos back porch &amp; fat guest room cigars <br />
on &amp; on &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oh no she didn&#39;t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; roll credits for jesus &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rape a rainbow in its sleep<br />
I&#39;m verifying my own virginity w/ a magnifying glass until the sun starts to burn through<br />
I been thank-you-much baptized in ape shit &amp; jungle funk since the day I was first misconstrued<br />
I still feel it running out the raging parties of my undies: reefer dens &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mushroom hells &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lazy <br />
underage keg stand&#39;s embarrassing back bend of death &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; why don&#39;t we maypole this day trip <br />
into pagan outer space? like some unstudied workweek rerun of my favorite sci-fi show on blow<br />
I&#39;m not changing my street name this late in the game &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not taking any rides downtown<br />
just to powder my ashes over the village oil can &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or snub the upchuck cuties on the corner<br />
for asking why my robot buttons glow no longer &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; short answer: my ALPHABENTITUS<br />
JUST DON&#39;T GO THERE tear my clumsy stunt double &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a new uptick esophagus <br />
suck the noxious tusk melt from my slutty mirror skirt &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at mid-dock I should have said it  <br />
sure as my former den mother is now an orthodontist &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sure as shit is getting out of hand</p>

lemon sorbet<br />
until the roof<br />
of my mouth<br />
cracks and bleeds<br />
with tartness.<br /><br />

A yearning<br />
to feel,<br />
even <br />
if it&#39;s just<br />
&quot;too cold,&quot;<br /><br />

is it innate<br />
in me, or<br />
was I destined<br />

floating<br />
in the<br />
