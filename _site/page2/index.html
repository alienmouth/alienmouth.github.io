          <div><p>The universe is doing well. There are many planets. There are many planets we cannot see. Planets with names like MOA-2007-BLG-192Lb.</p>

<p>In the Milky Way galaxy there are 100 to 400 billion planets. If you want to name a planet you can. Name it anything you want. </p>

<p>A person on Earth looks at a computer screen. The person is Larry Page. Larry Page has named two planets. Larry Page is looking at his computer screen thinking about eternity, non-existence, prostate cancer. Larry Page is going to die. In his next life, he hopes to be a Solitary Eagle, Harpyhaliaetus solitarius. He will live in South America, soar above the Peruvian rain forest.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, a person in a two-bedroom house watches a movie and laughs. Another person hides under a blanket and reads. Between the visible stars are more stars. Between Larry Page and the tree is twenty feet. Between Larry Page’s mind and the world is his skin.</p>

and hear the clinking of keys<br /><br /></p>

<p>a lemon in my mouth<br /><br /></p>

<p>I used to be forgiven<br />
but now I am not<br /><br /></p>

<p>an edge<br />
that rounded itself<br /><br /></p>

<p>there are windows everywhere I go<br />
but I hardly ever count them<br /><br /></p>

<p>I have never felt closer to god<br />
than when I smile at a TV show<br />
or maybe a child<br /><br /></p>

<p>the best things<br />
are when it is quiet<br />
and I am alone<br /><br /></p>

<p>I already know what your mouth tastes like:<br />
the forest floor<br /><br /></p>

<p>in short,<br />
wet.</p>

          <div><p>I.	city<br />
Where lives are controlled thru threats <br />
Drugs and violence. The audience<br />
hold crosses. Its ignorance  holds <br /> 
Down the universe twisting  fingers. At night <br />
My arms hold multi colored crystals. My black <br />
Gloves like a symbol of God holds the addicts.<br />
My friend’s think I’m a painter. <br /><br /></p>

<p>II.<br />
My name is Sunday. I survived <br />
Being a movie star. I felt  pain too much <br />
To be embarrassed. I’ve been the unemployed <br />
Friend. Quiet  dark and wrinkled. On  <br />
My stomach to soften my hunger. Good bye <br />
Not  the final word. If you believe that.<br /><br /></p>

<p>III.<br />
And suddenly <br />
Breaking into sunrise. I came crying.<br />
I repeated all that happened. I was <br />
In back seat when the car pulled over.<br />
An explosive human stampede<br />
Happening on my ribs and head<br />
Police stripped me out two grams<br />
And dragged along the empty street<br />
My lips wet with blood, I thought,<br />
This my murder.<br /><br /></p>

<p>IV<br />
Dying is an ancient disgrace like painting <br />
Poetry art literature. It’s dumb.  When I wake <br />
Up. Tell me you will  reach. Tell me you will <br />
Recognize. Tell me you will take<br />
 me to bed instead of your husband.<br /><br /></p>

<p>V.<br />
The faint sound of sirens connects me<br />
To this place. It’s a  place that reminds  us <br />
Of Egypt. The children chew tobacco weed <br />
Leaves <br />
And marshmallows produce  a sap <br />
Used to heal wounds.  Everyone watching<br />
Everyone.<br /></p>

          <div><p><strong>I Don’t Know How to Say This in Your Language</strong></p>

<p>The rain is drift-falling and layers</p>

<p>cannot save you from this winter.</p>

<p>On the sidewalk, an African immigrant</p>

<p>leans against concrete, his Air</p>

<p>Jordans leathered and grounded</p>

<p>in a shift of faces. I wonder</p>

<p>if there is an art to dying</p>

<p>young—if Turkish food markets</p>

<p>remind us good times aren’t forever.</p>

<p>Castles have fallen here but some</p>

<p>still watchdog the Spree,</p>

<p>pushing back against snow.</p>

<p>Yesterday we arrived to a</p>

<p>chestpunch of dark and cups of red</p>

<p>wine. We walked</p>

<p>to the farside until we no longer</p>

<p>knew ourselves, until they looked at us</p>

<p>for our tongues.</p>

<p><br /> <br /></p>

<p><strong>A Millennial Walks into a Bar and Says:</strong></p>

<p>Let’s start off with a Disney movie because why<br />
shouldn’t we? The one where the boy gets sucked<br />
into the game his father created. Virtual reality.<br /><br /></p>

<p>And let’s consider how there is an invisibility to<br />
everything. The way voices can break airwaves across <br />
oceans slapping against us. And let’s disregard<br /><br /></p>

<p>the tsunami ripples. Who takes responsibility for this, anyways?<br />
It’s an American thing to scream out take no prisoners in public. If not,<br />
it should be. Think of national security threats. Anonymous hackers<br /><br /></p>

<p>who break code. I asked my students what they thought<br />
about this and they told me about plaid shirts, the lag<br />
of internet, Wreckin’ Ralph. I’ve mentioned<br /><br /></p>

<p>another Disney movie I haven’t seen.<br />
But I sometimes worry about oil pipelines in North Dakota.<br />
About congress evil-scheming behind<br /><br /></p>

<p>us. They will plant lemon trees<br />
in our backyards and it’ll be okay. This is approval <br />
by majority so sit back and watch that shit grow. I apologize<br /><br /></p>

<p>if nothing bothers you. I am easily bothered. This brings me<br />
back to lemon trees and oil pipelines. Doesn’t this seem<br />
like Planet of the Apes? What if Charlton Heston was telling us<br /><br /></p>

<p>something when he said “I’m sending my last signal<br />
to Earth before we reach our destination.”<br />
This is a rough paraphrase. What isn’t rough?<br /><br /></p>

<p>When they discovered neon it was accidental.<br />
When they discovered continents it was accidental.<br />
When they discovered race it was accidental.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Maybe not. Maybe I’m saying history<br />
isn’t orchestrated by a perfect God. <br />
We are byproducts of earthquakes. And English<br /><br /></p>

<p>is commonly spoken everywhere. Does anyone<br />
care that it started with rape?<br />
Sometimes I speak in a voice that isn’t mine. Maybe <br /><br /></p>

<p>it’s yours. I apologize. I apologize a lot. I apologize<br />
for apologizing so much. In the 1940s<br />
a group of teenage boys were used<br /><br /></p>

<p>for experiments during the Holocaust. I learned about them<br />
during our tour of a death camp in Oranienburg.<br />
How the Germans kept them around for scientific purposes.<br /><br /></p>

<p>How those boys outlived German lieutenants. Poetic justice<br />
some might say. Meanwhile in the South Bronx teenagers<br />
built cultures from wax, DJed inside broken<br /><br /></p>

<p>down project buildings and spit fluids into crowds<br />
who kept their hands up until the break of dawn. A breaking<br />
dance motion. Contortion of the spirit. Head spins. Nothing<br /><br /></p>

<p>like U.S. military drones missing their targets. Nothing.<br />
But everything like jazz quartets. In New Orleans<br />
there are streets that have retained the noises of ghosts:<br /><br /></p>

<p>Tchoupitoulas; Calliope; St. Claude. Find me<br />
there. I want to remix the wrongs and make a mixtape<br />
of imperfections. Put it in your stereo.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Let your older brother get drunk to it. Let your grandmother<br />
fall asleep to this. Dreams are the origin of an end.<br />
Think about it. Flying cars and robots that act and look<br /><br /></p>

<p>fakingly real. Am I wrong for this? I really can’t say<br />
I’m Mexican just as I really can’t say<br />
I’m American. Someone built this bridge between me. They carved<br /><br /></p>

<p>hyphens from the air for me to cross. Not just the crossings<br />
you might be thinking. But the sort that can birth multiples: <br />
national borders, a puzzle, holy crucifixions, movements<br /><br /></p>

<p>across disparate bodies. I apologize again. I just did that thing<br />
when you use a word in your definition to define another word.<br />
I’m sure language is empired from mistakes so<br /><br /></p>

<p>I’d rather not take this to you. It might stifle what my friend Stan<br />
calls moon-guzzling. Instead, keep jogging until you reach<br />
the edge of yourself. And jump off. And find pleasure between your falling breaths.<br /><br /></p>

<p>The week before Obama’s presidency ended we drove<br />
to Half Moon Bay. There was 80s synthpop and a flood<br />
of trap wave playing. I found a decayed bunker on a cliffside:<br /><br /></p>

<p>aqua graffiti letters spelled INNA TRIBE. Yesterday,<br />
I ate ribs at a mom and pop’s in Hayward. The talk of teaching,<br />
of weddings, the slow goodness of slow-cooked BBQ inside us. Nobody<br /><br /></p>

<p>flinches. Imagine Jeff Chang and Chinaka Hodge hurling poems<br />
at the heads of protestors in our streets while something burns<br />
in the near distance. Orange horizons to remind us of unbroken nights.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Remember to drive slow and pump your brakes. An orchestra of Kanye.<br />
Shakir from West Oakland singing Italian operas—California<br />
house parties. Not like what you see in movies. Or maybe<br /><br /></p>

<p>it is. We were born here and raised up like the Redwoods. Who asked?<br />
Moving on, our neighbors are new and the old ones just moved out.<br />
Not always by choice. How does space change over time? It’s just time<br /><br /></p>

<p>they say. I don’t talk with my mom much because she bounces<br />
around, this time to LA. Video games are her pleasure. In Dragon Age Inquisition<br />
you play as a character who hunts dragons and has sex with others—<br /><br /></p>

<p>she explained this to me. I’ve never owned a PS4 though. In the magazine Wired<br />
you can read about two sisters from Seattle, ages 9 and 11, who built a Do-It-Yourself<br />
spacecraft out of simple materials, used a GoPro to capture its ascent<br /><br /></p>

<p>into the blindness of space. It’s all on YouTube. I wonder<br />
if our imaginations get wrinkled and weary like adults. I wonder<br />
if things are really things. I’d bet that all things eventually change<br /><br /></p>

<p>because someone didn’t want them to. (i.e. Civil Rights). How this<br />
can all pour from my fingers in a matter of minutes. Like newspapers<br />
becoming outdated. We mostly use Facebook as a source of news, anyways.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Entertainment doesn’t hide itself from us very well. At the gym,<br />
why do we look so discomfortable? At bars, why<br />
do we look so discomfortable? This is rude of me to ask on a first date,<br /><br /></p>

<p>I’ve been told. Perhaps the salad would have been a better choice.<br />
Locally foraged, says the 8-pt. font menu. Some of us would rather eat strawberries<br />
at home while watching Trevor Noah. Note to self: do this on a Wednesday night.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Remember, they need this. Remember, you need this. Everyday<br />
is a remembering of too many things. That’s why we keep calendars.<br />
Maybe I’ll cancel our plans and see what tomorrow shapes.<br /><br /></p>
