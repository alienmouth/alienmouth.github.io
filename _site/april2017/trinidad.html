	<p>she did not care if he was Christ, for in her arms he was her son, and she loved him, and it was all that mattered or would ever matter, she looked at the babe still smudged in viscera, <em>her blood,</em> and he was of her blood, and she loved him, and in her love he was of God, so was she, Mary was of God, and she felt God in the heat that flowed from this child, she felt God in the pain she bore and her emergence victorious, no one dead, not her, not her son, and for this miracle she would call him Jesus, and she pressed her lips next to his ear and whispered <em>you’ve saved me from death, you’ve saved me in your love, i will love you more devoutly than anyone now and forever, i am your Mother, i love you, i love you, my son, i will always love you</em></p>
