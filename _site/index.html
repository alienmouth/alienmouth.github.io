          <div><p>I see the crow split open<br />
when I should be watching the ocean,</p>

<p>a stain between frothing white lace<br />
and shell-bedded skin. I can’t stop thinking</p>

<p>about the utter wrongness of its body—<br />
talons curved inward yet still poised</p>

<p>for slaughter, the red wanting<br />
where a beak should be, eyes and mouth lost</p>

<p>to another creature’s hunger. I wonder if it drowned,<br />
those tarred wings wilting first, or if its neck</p>

<p>had given way like ribbon. I’m not sure<br />
which one I prefer. Either way,</p>

<p>there’s carnage. I think I’m in love <br />
right now and all I want is beaches</p>

<p>full of dead birds. A flood of limbs <br />
washing up onshore. Seascapes sparkling</p>

<p>bright with bone.  I know this longing well—<br />
the same way a knife only knows</p>

<p>the yielding purr of softness<br />
as the world curls around it,</p>

<p>how a shark only knows<br />
bloodshed &amp; swimming. This is</p>

<p>how bad it is: I need <br />
someone else’s mouthful</p>

<p>of glossed teeth, or at least<br />
something sharp in my throat. I deserve</p>

<p>a proper maiming. I hope I never<br />
get used to the wound.</p>

of hurt of home<br />
the walls dark under tongue<br />
a body of hurt a body of home<br />

at the limbs of shores<br />

          <div><p>There is no way to say it. Your window is collecting webs,<br />
your blackberries ripen and swell and fall</p>

<p>for the squirrels. Every day we spend less<br />
and less time waiting. Sometimes I stand on the roof</p>

<p>and say it into the wind: the first syllable<br />
rises and drops to the ground, and the second</p>

<p>gets lost in the forest between my mind and my mouth,<br />
to be picked apart by crows, who fly away</p>

<p>crying <i>rry, rry, rry.</i> I don’t know how I got here.<br />
How I made it here without you. All I did</p>

<p>was look back when you kept looking on,<br />
stumble through the dark in some</p>

<p>backwards way, kicking mushrooms, breadcrumbs,<br />
tripping over logs and nests, reaching</p>

<p>into your absence and finding suddenly<br />
a recognizable tree, and mother, out front, looking for stars.</p>

<p>I called for you, I swear. So did she.<br />
I try to say it in the morning, sitting on your bed:</p>

<p>but the first syllable gets caught in the webs<br />
of your open window, and when the spider comes</p>

<p>she wraps it up, pauses, whispers <i>so?</i>, and eats.<br />
Every day something of yours disappears.</p>

<p>The yellow dress, the small bird painting, and<br />
one by one the books. I move through our house</p>

<p>trying to say it. <i>I am so</i>, the clock has become<br />
bored by my eyes. <i>I am so</i>, I sleep terribly. <i>I am so</i></p>

          <div><p>I bought pepper spray yesterday cause it was $10<br />
&amp; bedazzled. It’s still in the box on the kitchen<br />
table. When I met Adam I was wearing a<br />
halo cause it was Halloween. I gave it to him cause<br />
he was turning 22 at midnight and also<br />
probably I fell in love or maybe out of the sky<br />
or both. We had so many sleepovers. We ordered<br />
so much Chinese food. We were so sad about<br />
money. Kelsey was followed home twice &amp;<br />
that was when I liked her so I was really empathetic.<br />
She has a knife with a cat on it even though<br />
she’s more of a dog person.  I have bedazzled<br />
pepper spray recommended by Cosmo<br />
in a plastic box on my kitchen table even though<br />
I’m more of a person who’s scared all the time.<br /></p>
