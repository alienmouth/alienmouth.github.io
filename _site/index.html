          <div><h1>Hansel, From Home: An Apology<br />
<i>(After Marie Howe’s Gretel From a Sudden Clearing)</i></h1>

<p>There is no way to say it. Your window is collecting webs,<br />
your blackberries ripen and swell and fall</p>

<p>for the squirrels. Every day we spend less<br />
and less time waiting. Sometimes I stand on the roof</p>

<p>and say it into the wind: the first syllable<br />
rises and drops to the ground, and the second</p>

<p>gets lost in the forest between my mind and my mouth,<br />
to be picked apart by crows, who fly away</p>

<p>crying <i>rry, rry, rry.</i> I don’t know how I got here.<br />
How I made it here without you. All I did</p>

<p>was look back when you kept looking on,<br />
stumble through the dark in some</p>

<p>backwards way, kicking mushrooms, breadcrumbs,<br />
tripping over logs and nests, reaching</p>

<p>into your absence and finding suddenly<br />
a recognizable tree, and mother, out front, looking for stars.</p>

<p>I called for you, I swear. So did she.<br />
I try to say it in the morning, sitting on your bed:</p>

<p>but the first syllable gets caught in the webs<br />
of your open window, and when the spider comes</p>

<p>she wraps it up, pauses, whispers <i>so?</i>, and eats.<br />
Every day something of yours disappears.</p>

<p>The yellow dress, the small bird painting, and<br />
one by one the books. I move through our house</p>

<p>trying to say it. <i>I am so</i>, the clock has become<br />
bored by my eyes. <i>I am so</i>, I sleep terribly. <i>I am so</i></p>

he was turning 22 at midnight and also<br />
probably I fell in love or maybe out of the sky<br />
or both. We had so many sleepovers. We ordered<br />
so much Chinese food. We were so sad about<br />
money. Kelsey was followed home twice &amp;<br />
that was when I liked her so I was really empathetic.<br />
She has a knife with a cat on it even though<br />
she’s more of a dog person.  I have bedazzled<br />

I’m more of a person who’s scared all the time.<br /></p>

          <div><p>Walking around like some dude with nothing to do, unaware of the current inner workings of my own mind.<br /><br />
All the people around don’t know anything, they’re so dumb.<br /><br />
Parachuting molly in Washington Sq. Park, I tell Audrey that I like stupid people, I just wish they were a little smarter.<br /><br />
“That’s the thing about the moon,” Audrey says, “if I wanted to, nothing could stop me from going there.”<br /><br />
I look up and mumble, “Jesus,” under my breath, “it’s like blankets,” I say, “the atmosphere, sky, it’s fucking blankets.”<br /><br />
Feeling not high enough, me and Audrey go back home to insufflate more MDMA where she asks about my first memory.<br /><br />
“A picnic,” I say, “with my mom and someone else, I don’t remember.”<br /><br />
“Stupid,” she says. <br /><br />
I display a disconcerted facial expression.<br /><br />
“Stupid memories,” she says to herself, “they don’t mean anything to anyone.”<br /><br />
On our way to the reading, I’m thinking about puddles and other bodies of water when a man punches me in the back of the head.<br /><br />
“Excuse me,” I say before laughing and walking away.<br /><br />
“Where do you think you’re going, motherfucker?” He says, “I’ll get you in your sleep!”<br /><br />
“Fuck off, Jerk-ass!” Audrey yells as the whole future feels like it’s opening up right in front of me.<br /><br />
“That was cool,” I observe.<br /><br />
“It was cool and kind of funny,” Audrey responds in the immediate aftermath.<br /><br />
We finally make it to the reading where Sarah pleads with me, “Theo, stop patting my back when we hug, just hug me for real!”<br /><br />
We’re all conversing within a group when Rachel jokingly says, “Where did my parents go wrong?”
“That’s a good tweet,” I say.<br /><br />
“That is a good tweet!” she rehashes. <br /><br />
After a mercifully short list of readers, me and Audrey go to the roof to smoke weed.<br /><br />
“It’s beautiful up here.”<br /><br />
“Roofs don’t really do anything for me,” she says.<br /><br />
“In the summertime, I’ll go on my roof everyday.”<br /><br />
“I’m not saying they’re bad, they’re just nothing special. I guess I enjoy the perspective, but-“<br /><br />
“I wasn’t trying to argue,” I say.<br /><br />
“It feels like you are.”<br /><br />
Waiting in line for the bathroom, Henry notes that not only are the current occupants probably doing drugs, but we also plan to do the same.<br /><br />
“It’s always so nice seeing you,” I tell him after sharing a laugh.<br /><br />
“I love you, Theo,” he says, his eyes becoming dull, “in confusing ways.”<br /><br />
“Thats,” I pause, “good to know.”<br /><br />
Showing off to Audrey, I hop down the last three steps of the stoop and shout, “I give tonight a 7/10!”<br /><br />
Discussing the recent meaningful interactions on our way home, I think about how how this time last year I was in San Francisco.<br /><br />
The hills toppled around like sedated seagulls, there was a lot of yellow and pink, even nicer things probably.<br /><br />
It’s weird how I always feel like the same person until I think about stuff for a little while.<br /><br />
“You never pay any attention to me,” Audrey says as it starts to rain.<br /><br />
I sincerely apologize to her.<br /><br />
“Rain, rain,” she says a few times until her voice quiets to a low murmur, “this is a secret to everyone asleep.”<br /><br />
The next day, I wake up and it feels distinctly like a fade-in, or maybe a very long dissolve, through waking, pooping, showering whilst singing, dressing too long, coffee-ing, smoking, eating, smoking, talking too loudly, whispering unnecessarily, wondering hopefully, sleeping maybe.<br /><br />
Ugh, I don’t want to get out of bed, there’s nothing to do and it’s all so hard.<br /><br />
My roommate’s cats tip a glass off the coffee table and look me in the eyes.<br /><br />
“Bastards,” I whisper dramatically and laugh.<br /><br />
I visualize laughter as something akin to magnetic waves that intensifies in proximity to domesticated animals.<br /><br />
“Holy shit,” I realize, “I can apply meaning to anything.”<br /><br />
I stare out the window at a spot on the neighboring building, a group of bricks midway between two third floor windows, and think to myself, “This must be it, this must be meaning.”<br /><br /></p>

<p>I – INPUT: / OUTPUT:<br /></p>

<p>To my many young and beautiful friends <br />
who used to be lovers:<br />
and the rest: who work <br />
now work to pieces of people<br /> 
at computers: to all <br />
creatives: never the lesser ended<br />
great use for these eight fingers,<br />
to fear the momentum <br />
of stack-handles, to feet on the slight <br />
of the roll-along floor, the<br />
skin-pocked carpets of our future<br />
barred to the door, to make love, <br />
I reckon<br />
in pixels, only<br />
only to each other,<br />
in the basement of a library.<br />
Against the days-numbered decimals<br />
of Aristotle:<br />
ΠΕΡΙ ΑΙΣΘΗΣΕΩΣ ΚΑΙ ΑΙΣΘΗΤΩΝ.<br />
(trans.) I feel young, benumbed and taut together.<br />
Those unwarranted, unexplained <br />
capital letters.<br />
Poems as rigid, too, as rigid as those letters,<br />
the lifelike mnemonic of time<br />
blending two past lovers,<br />
my mind estranged by the law<br />
that water is the thinnest of all the liquids<br />
more difficult than oil even<br />
to cup in the hand.<br /></p>

          <div><p><strong>Untitled</strong><br />
<br />
I was a fountain choreographer<br />
in purple sheets, given to glass worship.<br />
I was statues, too, broken down to chips,<br />
when the rumor died down at the altar.<br />
Elle ordered me (again) to Love My Hair,<br />
when France and Russia fought over warships,<br />
when we were two people meant to Ketchup;<br />
but wasn’t that your job? (I mean, the hair).<br />
Back when I spent my money on Moleskines -<br />
they still write, to ask me if I want more.<br />
I don’t know how to answer such questions,<br />
so instead I tell them I want more skin,<br />
because we stretched the rumor till it tore,<br />
and then left it to yellow in the sun.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Marbles</strong><br />
<br />
The morning after the cow lost her calf,<br />
the symptoms set in.<br />
<br />
The planarian split into two,<br />
3.4 miles from shore.<br />
<br />
The slanted city/a spineless island,<br />
sent the marbles on a downward roll.<br />
<br />
Then with the drill (it’s a hands-on city):<br />
don’t fix the shelves, please, just fill in the hole.<br />
<br />
When I fell, I felled the topography.<br />
<br />
You misunderstood me a hundred times,<br />
yet here I am again, infralapsing.<br />
<br />
So: there was your way and there was mine,<br />
respecting our original parting.<br />
<br />
Buried under a tree came back bolder:<br />
that bell I found. Remember? I told you.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Windows</strong><br />
<br />
They are all talking about <br />
the storm windows <br />
but none of them saw <br />
the note on the sink,<br />
the one that kept it to storms,<br />
on how to condition the storms <br />
for storms. <br />
<br />
And while they sign off in the copse,<br />
through their talk of squalls<br />
comes our daughter’s voice, <br />
supplicating the raspberries, <br />
those that dilly-dallied into September, <br />
so old they taste like jam. <br />
<br />
The woman who lived here <br />
made her nest in a town <br />
kept honest by wood.<br />
 <br />
Now an auctioneer codes <br />
a shovel full of buttons<br />
rested on a child’s sled <br />
and a julep Rabbit,<br />
68,000 miles tired. <br />
<br />
It reminds me of a cabinet <br />
where birds were laid to rest <br />
in cotton balls. <br />
<br />
No one is really from this town<br />
and the only wood to ever come from here <br />
was splintered, dipped in sulphur, <br />
and inflamed against diminutive <br />
adirondack chairs. <br />
<br />
Our daughter pockets an acorn,<br />
convincing us both she has taken <br />
something valuable.<br /></p>

          <br><span class="smaller">by JT Farrell on June 22, 2016</span>  <br/>
          <div><p>Remember being small next to the sea? So small you couldn’t begin to understand its size, didn’t even think to try? Remember refusing sunscreen, searching for shells, collecting rocks, chasing the receding ocean out? Squealing when it chased us back in? Remember sandcastles? Make-believe? Building forts?</p>

<p>Remember when you moved? Didn’t want to go but packed everything up into boxes boxes boxes anyway and changed homes across town. Divorce. Lost things in transit. Like your stuffed shark. Remember? Got a new one, but it wasn’t the same. Nothing was the same. New room, new house, new yard, new neighbors. You hid deep under sheets blankets pillows for a long time. Didn’t want to come out. Told me about it later. I didn’t get it. The big deal.</p>

<p>I remember visiting the new house. Small. White walled. Empty. Except for cardboard boxes stacked to ceilings in steps we scaled, climbed one by one. Shouted at the top, conquering kings of a new empty world. Unafraid. In the background your dad unpacked and we stood unafraid, surrounded by the sound of masking tape tearing off of cardboard.
He yelled at us to get down. Dangerous. We’d fall. Didn’t listen.</p>

<p>Took a long time to unpack those boxes. They stayed at your new house for months. Never think you have that much until you have to pack it all up and unpack it again. Got used to it. When they were gone, house became strange. Neat. Got used to that too. Wanted boxes back at first. We got good use out of them.</p>

<p>Remember that still day at the edge of the sea? Light haze over sand glowed in full sunlight. Figures silhouetted in mist moved back and forth along the sand. Bird shapes flapped away the distance over the water. Skies blue through the blur. Sand soft and warm. Water cold and dark. As always.</p>

<p>Remember rebuilding the fort? You convinced me to. I was sand-in-eyes defeated, sitting legs straight out trying not to cry at the boxes from your house strewn across the beach. Derelict ruins of a dream. Once-mighty castle cast low by marauding invaders older and meaner and cooler than we were. Came clad in bathing suits and towels and knocked it over. Couldn’t understand why. All our work and triumph wrecked for no reason. No reason at all. Was ready to go back to your beach-chaired dad drinking beer in his baseball hat and ask to leave. Give up. You convinced me to stay. Remember?</p>

<p>Said we’d make the fort taller. Bigger. Better. So we could see the whole ocean from it. Then you pushed one box up against another. And again. Weighed them down with sand so the wind couldn’t take them. I watched you through wet eyes. Then wiped tears away. Brushed off sand. Dragged a box to the structure. Pushed it against the others. Covered the open flaps with sand. Brought another over.</p>

<p>Worked without speaking. Dragged my feet. Sniffled. But helped you form the foundation. Stronger than before. Tunnel leading to the center. Stacked second layer on top and felt better. I remember that. The fort taking shape again. And you were right. It was bigger. Better.</p>

<p>Took longer to build the second time. The boxes were weaker. And we got tired. But we kept working. Talked while we worked. Wonder what we talked about. Maybe you told me you saw a great white shark yesterday, I said nu-uh you’d be eaten. Maybe I told you about how some fish make their own lights, you said they don’t know how to use electricity. Maybe you asked what dinosaur I’d be, I said Velociraptor. You said you’d be T-Rex and eat Velociraptor. I said no way, I’d be Pterodactyl. Fly away. Leave you stuck on the ground. Maybe you asked what super power I’d be, I said I’d be fast. You said you’d turn invisible.</p>

<p>But we rebuilt it. The fort. Citadel of cardboard, boxes push-piled against each other high up on the beach to survey the entire empty sea expanse. To stand tall on top of. To fight off rival pirate raiders. To howl atop our edifice in animal defiance. We were heroes. Bigger. We were titans. Better. Dinosaurs. We came before everything. Still be there when it’s all gone. So we played. Fought and died and woke up and made plans and fought and saved people and were tortured and the fort shifted so we adjusted. Parts fell and we put them back. New angles formed. New corners appeared. New passages. Tunnels. Walls. Changed and grew as the day got late and the tide inched in.</p>

<p>Until your dad came to get us. You noticed him before me. Down on the sand, shouting with an empty bottle in his hand. Time to go.</p>

<p>We didn’t want to leave. Five more minutes. Please only five more minutes. But no. Time to go. Didn’t want to make him angry. Then it was your turn to be upset. But you got quiet. Still do that sometimes. Back then it scared me. Especially that time. You wouldn’t talk to your dad. Wouldn’t look at your dad. Walked across sand back to the car. Your dad dropped the bottle in the trash at the entrance to the parking lot. Hot asphalt under bare feet.</p>

<p>Made it to the car. We brushed the sand off outside while your dad threw the beach chair in the trunk. He had started letting you sit in front seat, even though your mom didn’t, but you got in back with me. Arms crossed. Eyes down.</p>

<p>I tried to help. The way you helped when the fort fell and I cried. Said, it’s okay. We can go back and play in the fort again tomorrow and rebuild it if we need to. Then your dad said the tide’s coming in, it won’t be there tomorrow. Voice thick and heavy from the front seat. I could only see his pocked ear poking through salt and pepper hair.</p>

<p>You didn’t say anything. Like you couldn’t even hear us.</p>

<p>So I replied, no. We built it high enough. The boxes will still be there.</p>

<p>Your dad focused on the road. I imagined the fort standing tall through the night as waves broke around it.</p>

<p>Your dad said, if you say so. I don’t know what you kids see in those boxes anyway. They’re only boxes, empty boxes.</p>

<p>Then you spoke.</p>

<p>But you can climb them. You can stack them up on top of each other and climb them. And then once you’re up there you can see everything and everyone. If you don’t climb them you only see the stupid empty boxes.</p>

<p>Your dad didn’t respond. Drove back in silence. Dropped me off at home. You went back to yours, less empty but still bare between white walls. Remember? Everything unpacked at that point, things everywhere. But you didn’t want things from inside the boxes. Opened them with rip tear sound of masking tape and soon they became empty boxes. So you climbed them. And when they fell down you rebuilt and climbed again. Remember?</p>

<p>I went back to the beach the next day. Not sure I ever told you. Took the bus. To play on the boxes again. Longer walk than I remembered, sand shifting under foot. When I got to the spot there was nothing. Fort gone. Not a single box. Not a scrap of cardboard. The water washed it all away.</p>

          <div><h2>SIMONE WEIL READ BY MASOCHIST</h2>

<p>my way is to shrink<br />
in the presence of greatness<br /></p>

<p>a disappearing impulse that reacts <br />
in proportion to the degree of force<br /></p>

<p>this is how i come to god<br /></p>

<p>on my knees, hands bound<br />
behind my back, begging<br /></p>

<p><i>please, fuck me, daddy</i></p>

<h2>GREGORY</h2>

<p>sleeping in my mother’s apartment<br />
in my hometown i dreamt <br />
about my childhood<br />
rapist, who told me that it<br />
was a bourgeois notion to believe<br />
that all my friends should<br />
bring me comfort. i got<br />
red in the face and wanted<br />
to scream but didn’t run<br />
or fight<br /></p>

<h2>UNIVERSAL MONSTER</h2>

<p>there are all these little forgettings<br /></p>

<p>like i can’t remember <br />
what my nose looks like<br />
under all these bandages<br /></p>

<p>tracing the contours of this stitched<br />
up frankenstein’s monster line<br />
across my scalp<br /></p>

<p>the doctor says i’ve got <br />
a strong monster line <br />
lucky in love line <br /></p>

<p>now in my need for dramatics <br />
we’re covering all the mirrors<br />
and isn’t this fun<br /></p>

<p>like we’re vampires<br />
holed up in mexico<br /></p>

<p>like how fast does a mirror image fade<br />
when you turn away<br /></p>

<h2>ORDINAL</h2>

<p>i like the phrase devil’s <br />
threesome because it implies to me<br />
the existence of a spiritual ranking<br />
of threesomes<br /></p>

<p>i looked into a mirror that said<br />
meet the person most responsible<br />
for your safety <br />
and that felt like a lot<br />
of pressure<br /></p>

<p>ideally <br />
i would like to be standing <br />
between two large men <br />
with safe hands and<br />
the devil watching<br /></p>

left softly <br />
by boats,<br />
their crews <br />

up and <br />

me in<br />

honey in <br />

my pores <br />
leak, no<br />

slow rot<br />

my amour<br />

down on<br />

wet payloads <br />

flaring silently <br />

me, that <br />

flesh becomes:<br />
something pestilential,<br />
something you’d <br />
catapult over<br />

my body<br />
more as <br />

something i<br />

          <br><span class="smaller">by Jeremy Radin on June 22, 2016</span>  <br/>
          <div><p><strong>Dear Sal,</strong><br />
<br />
In a room on the river <br />
we crooned hymns <br />
to honeysuckle, eulogized <br />
a stuffed trout, carved nectarines <br />
&amp; waltzed within <br />
the scent. You fed me <br />
dark bread slathered in butter <br />
&amp; I did not speak of <br />
the French, the Germans, my mouth <br />
too full of sweetnesses. Your steady hands <br />
aglow, you touched me <br />
with such unbearable <br />
attention, accurate <br />
fingers unlacing the slaughter, <br />
numbers &amp; the names of countries <br />
crumbling in your eyes.<br />
<br />
<strong>Dear Sal,</strong><br />
<br />
For nearly a year I have been building a Word. <br />
Hammering letters together, welding with a torch<br />
that shoots a tongue-colored flame. I began<br />
<br />
my work while remembering your pinky. How she <br />
stands apart from all the others. They, a cluster <br />
of gossips; she, preening, disturbing the sensibilities. <br />
<br />
It is almost finished, the Word. I would say it here <br />
but the walls would come crashing down. I wish <br />
to say it in your house. In your father, mother,<br />
<br />
brother &amp; his twelve-gauge altar. Instead I holler <br />
recipes at lizards, cry Kaddish over birds that dash<br />
their brains out on the door. The Word is going <br />
<br />
extinct in my mouth. Sing with me, Bashert, once <br /> 
more. There is not enough room in the world<br />
for our silence.
<br />
<strong>Dear Sal,</strong><br />
<br />
Burning beds in a field I command the light, unleash it in the direction of your dress.<br />
I repeat your name to a cavalry of stars, hold to their noses a section of your dress.<br />
<br />
You found me trembling like a donkey at the altar, starving &amp; skinny, my hair a ghost’s nest.<br />
You took me inside to bind my wound in water, nourish me on the confection of your dress.<br />
<br />
A basket of peaches underneath your arm, the orchards of silence uprooted in your chest,<br />
you stroll through the blinding honeysuckle, its scent the only explanation for your dress.<br />
<br />
A sycamore sags on the side of a road, bones of a forgotten saint, unsung &amp; under-blessed.<br />
May you be delivered up from her roots, may you bloom in the rich salvation of her dress.<br />
<br />
How dark is the sum of the unburied dead? They scale the moonlight &amp; bellow distress.<br />
What relief awaits when you unfold the fabrics &amp; open the organization of your dress.<br />
<br />
Refugees cascade from the mouths whales, in a language of no they are the last remaining yes.<br />
I came from the dark with a war in my teeth, seeking clemency here in the nation of your dress.<br />
<br />
I die in in the tub as the coffee is brewing - I am lifted by the angels, I am lifted by regrets.<br />
I am brought back to life in a room on the river, howling about the negation of your dress.<br />
<br />
<strong>Dear Sal,</strong><br />
<br />
After all these years I’ve reached my age. To celebrate I eat a tuna salad on rye<br />
the size of a Buick. There is the mishegas &amp; there is the mishegas. The man who<br />
gave me a voice, he didn’t even speak the language. Oy, what a shondeh. Do you <br />
know what the word Bashert means? It means I would go back to Europe for you. <br />
I would eat mayonnaise on the Eiffel Tower. I would surround a tree with presents <br />
for the phantoms of our children, sing to the Rhine in the language of my people. <br />
If that, Bashert, is your wish. What have I been trying to say about desire? Stuffing <br />
tuna salad sandwich into my mouth. It is not something I can afford. At this time <br />
of day the park is almost empty. I want to hide in the grass &amp; make animal sounds,<br />
get the whole damn place to myself. Bashert, imagine! Just the two of us, strolling<br />
hand in hand, the beast of longing whimpering under our shoes. We call it longing <br />
because it takes forever. I am, years old. How can it matter? I hope somehow I have <br />
made you laugh. What do you call the most Jewish fish? The anchoyvey. I made that<br />
one up while the moon ate my legs. Ah yes, &amp; the shadow is mine. My beard, heavy <br />
with fish &amp; salt &amp; seeds. What do you call a garden on the bottom of the ocean? <br />
When the garden rises up in you, Bashert, what do you call?</p>

<p>the wedding is at the house<br />
I’d drive to after track practice,<br />
the house she grew up in,<br />
where we’d play Beetle Adventure Racing<br /></p>

<p>the first time I went<br />
to Sarah’s house, I’d never taken that left<br />
in front of the SuperMall before,<br />
I didn’t know there was a town there,<br />
that I imagine exists as a self-sustained world<br />
built just for you, with a Dairy Queen<br />
and library<br /></p>

<p>those summer nights we’d go to the park<br />
across the street from Robyn’s house<br />
and push each other on the tire swing<br /></p>

<p>and after things changed,<br />
I was still friends with your sister<br />
I would swoop her in my truck<br />
and I would see you standing<br />
and watching<br /></p>

<p>I walked to the 7-Eleven<br />
on the intersection of M and 8th Street,<br />
the one we’d go to after Monday track practice,<br />
the one across the street from Teriyaki Wok,<br />
where we drank Slurpees in the bed of my truck<br /></p>

<p>7-Eleven is now a boulangerie<br />
with floor to ceiling windows on a boulevard,<br />
watching bakers as they enter,<br />
I’m drinking banana flavored coffee<br /></p>

<p>I see nouveau riche in front of over-flowing<br />
trash cans eating foie gras and burger dogs,<br />
and the parks down the street, called Scootie Brown<br />
and Indian Tom, changed their names<br />
to Jamison Square and Tanner Springs<br /></p>

<h2>Secoma Lanes</h2>

<p>I’m imagining taking the drive<br />
to Pullman tomorrow instead,<br />
through the Cascades and Columbia,<br />
and the corn flowers blooming,<br />
and the green glow of a car dashboard<br />
in a rural college town<br /></p>

<p>I used a hookah for the first time in Pullman<br />
at a place called Munchy’z. I was 18,<br />
in town for ‘Imagine Tomorrow’,<br />
an alternative energy science fair<br /></p>

<p>I watched 6 hours of Intervention today<br />
it made me feel things<br />
that I’m not sure how to identify—<br />
I don’t know if I felt an amalgam of feelings<br />
or if I felt something that people don’t feel<br />
often enough to have named yet<br /></p>

<p>I watched a video on youtube about<br />
humans ceasing to exist<br />
they said whole neighborhoods<br />
would be up in smoke as soon as lightning struck<br /></p>

<h2>Seattle Aquarium</h2>

<p>Oliver is visiting from Australia<br />
I meet him and Zac at Alleyway<br />
I ask Oliver what Perth is like<br />
because I’m thinking about Susanna,<br />
and wondering if she still lives in Perth,<br />
or if she moved back to her small city in Japan<br /></p>

<p>Oliver tells me about the difference<br />
between Melbourne and Sydney until<br />
I feel interested in Australia—<br />
not for a previous lack of interest,<br />
I just already think so much<br />
about so many places<br /></p>

<p>I mention a memory from senior prom:<br />
we went to Chase’s—a split level house,<br />
with meat rotting on the dining room table<br />
and yellow cigarette tar on the walls<br /></p>

<p>we smoked Backwoods inside,<br />
Chase was stoned and Kirk played<br />
Beach House over the speakers,<br />
and Chase said ‘this music scares me’<br /></p>

<p>Earlier that night, prom was at the Seattle Aquarium,<br />
and after eating too much fondue,<br />
I went to a concrete observation deck,<br />
looked up at downtown Seattle.<br />
the world seemed lonely and big<br /></p>

<p>I go to Zac’s to sleep on his couch<br />
because I missed the last bus home<br /></p>

<p>after prom, as the sun came up,<br />
everyone went to bed on Chase’s basement floor<br />
I drove my mom’s minivan home<br />
across Auburn, so she could use it that morning<br /></p>

<p>earlier on prom night, Isaiah stopped by Chase’s<br />
his tie was loosened and his collar undone<br />
‘I had the best sex of my life in the car’, he said<br />
I think he conceived his firstborn that night<br /></p>

<h2>christmas lights</h2>

<p>I want to watch Dragon Ball Z with you<br />
you’re in Washington with me<br />
but you’re in Seattle and I’m in Auburn<br />
you’re in a motel and I’m on Kirk’s back patio<br />
and I don’t know even if you like Dragon Ball Z<br /></p>

<p>spaces feel different when the spaces<br />
are related to other space in a new way<br />
like when I stopped by 7-Eleven<br />
on the way home from working<br />
at the carnival, I saw it as an island<br />
in darkness and I didn’t know<br />
Dairy Queen was across the street<br /></p>

<p>but then I learned that behind that Dairy Queen<br />
is what would become your house<br />
and that 7-Eleven became part of the fabric<br />
of something much bigger<br /></p>

<p>I imagine you went to a Chinese garden,<br />
I see you behind a tea house and pond<br />
you are standing perfect and perfectly still,<br /></p>

<p>I want to see you under<br />
the Christmas lights above my bed,<br />
that make your stomach skin look blue—<br />
every color of light is within those Christmas lights,<br />
so why does your skin only reflect blue?<br /></p>

<h2>hot tub</h2>

<p>I remember at one of Jack’s big house parties,<br />
not long before college,<br />
I crawled into the hot tub in my underwear<br />
four people joined me, including<br />
Dwight and Danielle—they were dating at the time<br />
we talked about the future and high school<br /></p>

<p>we climbed on to the trampoline<br />
and we laid flat on our backs<br />
in the young, breezy, summer,<br />
night air like a heated swimming pool<br /></p>

<p>Kirk played his guitar laying down<br />
we looked at space,<br />
and talked to each other without<br />
ever looking away from that canopy<br />
that looked like negative exposures<br />
of a stucco ceiling, and the whole time<br />
you kept chain smoking on the back porch<br /></p>

summer is long gone<br />
winter is yet to come<br />
let alone the spring but<br />
let me come to think of it;<br />
about the brown fall for<br />
it can be a perfect lesson<br />
about how death, of leaves<br />
and living things, at the very<br />
least, is beautiful and<br />
ephemeral and beautiful and<br />
ephemeral and be—<br />

ii.<br />
:: apollo<br />
exploding tanks, wasted oxygen,<br />
choked throats, dry lungs, almost lost<br />
forever in foreign space and home;<br />
but home was the last thing we recalled<br />
because the suits that allowed us to walk<br />
inside this zero gravity cubicle<br />
needed to call a small station in that<br />
rotting blue planet, first of all<br />
we were almost forever lost<br />
yet home was calling us home<br />
<br />
iii.<br />

he gazes through the window<br />

of himself, stamp and airmail,<br />
an old office he will someday leave<br />
for retirement but then he checks his<br />
phone and giggles and stops mumbling<br />
<br />
iv.<br />
:: astral<br />
look at the girl in sweater<br />
and brunette milk braids<br />
crying while knotting the<br />
dead dots beyond the skies<br />
we can hear you, little girl<br />
don’t hope for silly things like<br />
getting new band merch for<br />
christmas or losing weight<br />
to the constellations because<br />
even when we have lived here<br />
for million years, we are still<br />
unseen, our hopes are crashing<br />
and burned like one of those dead<br />
dots, again, but we are also one of<br />
the dead dots, again, just in the<br />
other side of galaxy you don’t see<br />

<br />
The rain wrote <br />
rhythms on your<br />
bathroom window,<br />
begged, let<br />
me in, but<br />
it could never<br />
cleanse you<br />
like the sound<br />
of the toilet<br />
flushing<br />
your 550 calorie<br />
dinner.<br />
<br />
<strong>Purge #2</strong><br />
<br />
Your neck nearly snapped<br />
when you whipped your head back<br />
toward me, fingers<br />
still pressed<br />
against the toilet.<br />
<br />
<strong>Crumb</strong><br />
<br />
If I eat less they’ll love me If I eat less they’ll think I’m beautiful If I eat less they’ll stop staring at my plate My stomach My sausage-link fingers And maple syrup-sweat stained armpits Stop staring at me like split-pea soup spills out of my mouth each and every time I try to talk Expecting me to cry and cry and cry and cry and cry and thank them as they tell me they’re worried about me Eating my food Their food Everybody’s God damn food If I eat less they’ll love me If I eat less they’ll think I’m beautiful If I eat less they’ll win then I’ll look like them I don’t want to look like them I want to look like me If I eat less they’ll flick flick flick me off the table I’ll eat less until I’m nothing but a crumb<br />

<strong>Ukulele</strong><br />
<br />
Luke gave me his mom’s Newports.<br />
She hid them in the bathroom, buried<br /> 
beneath body towels because<br />
she lied—told her family she quit<br />
after surviving Breast Cancer.<br />
<br />
I took them to school with me,<br />
zipped up in the front pocket<br />
of my backpack.<br />
<br />
I sold them to the alley kids<br />
for a dollar a smoke because<br />
they needed something<br />
to look forward to, and<br />
I needed money<br />
to buy a ukulele.<br /></p>

          <div><p>Imagining what my life might have looked like if I’d been<br />
undersexed: a junkie, perhaps, or someone who made<br />
a great deal of money. The branch is bare where the kitten<br />
once clung, its eyes telling me to hang in there. Or was it<br />
me, imploring the kitten (&amp; why should I wish for the<br />
kitten to let go)? We must all hang in there together, <br />
or assuredly we will all hang in there separately. <br />
They sang about chasing the dragon, but it was just <br />
a kitten, purring in the wilderness. Where there’s smoke, there’s <br />
a dragon, &amp; where there’s kitsch, there’s a kitten. Imagining <br />
what life might have looked like if there hadn’t been nine of them.<br />
Imagining Steely Dan chasing the kitten instead,<br />
time out of mind but not, alas, out of joint. Oh, kitten:<br />
maybe you didn’t drop. Maybe you raptured straight up. <br />
Maybe you simply landed on your feet like, you know, a<br />
cat. Maybe I’m simply staring at the wrong bare branch. <br />
Undersexed isn’t the right word, but it doesn’t matter<br />
because I wasn’t, I’m not. Still, I’ll never have a mug<br />
that says World’s Greatest Dad. Or a kitten, or a cat.<br />
But I cling to the branch.  Persistance. Pass it on. Pass by. <br />
That beautiful highway shimmies in the sunbaked twilight.<br />
Behind the billboards, dragons dream, passed out atop bags <br />
of gold, snoring smog, imagining what life might have looked <br />
like if they’d chased a ball of yarn instead of the sublime. <br />
Imagining the sublime up a tree again, dammit,<br />
one more distraction, the goddamned stupid sublime. No, not <br />
imagining. Knowing. All those hours. Picking them out of<br />
a line-up. Telling them, one by one, to just hang in there. <br />
Where the air is rarefied, &amp; every branch is bare,<br />
&amp; the fireman on his ladder finds peace at last.<br /></p>

<br />
Throw your baseball cap<br />
in the dishwasher.   (This<br />
could be your son.)   Use <br />
diminutive language.   Clean<br />
the kitchen, try to get<br />
high.   Remember:   you are fascinated<br />

a human being.<br />
              A letter comes<br />
to “DAD” from Richmond.   For fear<br />
of Federales, do not open.   It’s probably<br />
an acronym.   Instead, buy expensive<br />
underpants.   Knit a knit suitcase<br />
reinforced with discarded three-<br />
ring binders.   Swallow everything.<br />

<strong>Explication</strong><br />
<br />
I am behind you <br />
in the stairwell<br />
explaining my <br />
absence, that I had<br />
purchased a book<br />
and would accept <br />
two more.   I appreciate <br />
value.   I will buy<br />
two toothpaste tubes <br />
for the price of one-<br />
and-a-half.   I am <br />
a happy American.<br />
I am fit enough <br />
to enjoy a little<br />
snacking.   I have <br />
a girlfriend.   I have<br />
a twelve-speed bike.<br />
My girlfriend<br />

I was androgynous as a ten-<br />

beautiful eyelashes <br />

<strong>Dear,</strong><br />
<br />
all of these salted<br />
crackers represent<br />
love.   jangling keys<br />
stand for consumerism<br />
and self concept:<br />
catalytic, you leave me<br />
without nexus— excited<br />
particles conform to skin<br />
of a balloon giraffe,<br />
an emptied mayonnaise jar<br />
<br />
the physical aspect of matter<br />
is a kind of honorific assigned<br />
to colliding energies— particles<br />
of space connecting space<br />
so when my sleeves give way to elbows<br />
whatever’s really going on<br />
has as much to do with being still<br />
as a swinging lamp,<br />
bleeding lotus flowers<br />
and rose-red wine.<br />

<strong>[How to un-do things:]</strong><br />

How to un-do things:<br />
Cut directly through<br />
the center—peel the subject’s<br />
skin, fit to something more<br />
deserving.   We are<br />
all divine, perfect images<br />
of a vengeful schizoid—<br />
There is nothing more<br />
frustrating than waiting<br />
in line at the Post Office,<br />
and little halves of books<br />
are kind and unassuming.<br />
The best customer <br />
is a repeat customer.<br />
For these many years<br />
rain’s been falling sulfur<br />
dioxide and various mono<br />
nitrogen-oxide hammers.<br />
I billow through the troposphere<br />
collecting notes for maps.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>My Body</strong><br />
<br />
Parts of me are falling off<br />
and acting like they know what’s going on.<br />
An expression of my recessive genes<br />
has appointments in two different cities,<br />
each accessible by greyhound.<br />
My nose inchworms across the carpet,<br />
encouraging comprehensive empathy<br />
for other selves I’ve met.   Not that I need<br />
reminders, really, it’s just there are<br />
so many parts. My nasopharynx wants<br />
to eat Korean noodles—the rest<br />
disagree.   I’m glad you seem to understand;<br />
I want someone who seems<br />
     to understand.<br /></p>

Since when are we satisfied<br />

Even though I wanted to.</p>

<p>i'm tired of <br />
falling in &amp; out<br />
of love with people<br />
every single night</p>

<p>there are only so many ways<br />
to show what side of the lake you're on</p>

<p><b>I'D RATHER BE BEAUTIFUL THAN MALE</b></p>
<p>"The moon is trans.<br /><br />

From this moment forward, the moon is trans.<br /><br />

You don’t get to write about the moon anymore unless you respect that.<br /><br />

You don’t get to talk to the moon anymore unless you use her correct pronouns."<br /><br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- joshua jennifer espinoza</p>
<p>&amp; when the big dumb moon fell into our bed<br />
i was right in the middle of telling you<br />
about how i would like to coach your favorite baseball team<br />
&amp; after she fell into our bed<br />
the moon asked about phases<br />
why hers were called phases<br />
&amp; how scary that word is<br />
you told her <i>the sky<br />
changes colors <br />
turning blue &amp; purple<br />
like the body</i><br />
she understood<br />
kind of<br />
&amp; i told her <br />
she's not ready for everything<br />
<i>that's okay<br />
we're all okay<br />
your light hits all of us<br />
so we are all you<br />
a small part of each of us<br />
is the moon<br />
&amp; she's beautiful</i><br />
i said <i>we are all the moon<br />
&amp; we are all butterflies <br />
who think living for a day<br />
is living for a lifetime<br />
even though some of us<br />
can't keep going <br />
especially after seeing our naked bodies</i><br />
&amp; the first time i looked<br />
into the mirror after cutting my hair<br />
i was finally beautiful<br />
just kidding <br />
i have always been beautiful<br />
the moon swore she heard someone crying <br />
outside of our window<br />
we ignored it<br />
she said <i>i think we should really check on them</i><br />
&amp; i said <i>we're always feeling glaciers moving <br />
at the bottom of our stomachs</i><br />
i said this to no one in particular <br />
so then the moon asked me<br />
when i started wearing glasses<br />
&amp; at this point <br />
you had gotten out of bed <br />
to get some water<br />
so you didn't hear this part<br />
but i said<br />
<i>i can remember when my dad started wearing glasses<br />
but not my mom<br />
my mom can't really see me anymore</i><br />
&amp; then the room filled up with air <br />
the kind that fills up rooms<br />
before it rains<br />
the moon asked me <br />
if i ever experienced <br />
a major death in my family &amp; i said <br />
<i>no<br />
can we go back to talking about how beautiful you are<br />
can we go back to talking about all the love poems <br />
i tried to write for each bridge i've walked over but never did<br />
can you watch me foam at the mouth with every cloud <br />
that ever existed<br />
but slowly disappeared</i><br />
&amp; then you came back into the room<br />
but it was too dark so i didn't notice <br />
&amp; continued to tell the moon about the time my astronomy professor <br />
told my class that we were never supposed to be here<br />
&amp; how us being here<br />
alive on earth <br />
is the same probability of winning the lottery 100,000 times<br />
how fucked up is that?<br />
&amp; then i had to leave the room because i needed to cry in the rain<br />
so i'm not sure what you &amp; the moon talked about which is fine i guess<br />
i just want to know<br />
will you please stop leaving all the photographs in the fridge?<br />
pressing the buttons on a camera makes strawberries<br />
according to a four year old<br />
who is taking pictures of beautiful things<br />
with a camera that doesn't work<br />
&amp; before the moon left<br />
she made everything quiet for us<br />
so we could hear the universe's slow hum<br />
i could imagine the weather <br />
on the day every person i know was born<br />
the first day of K's life was probably the only day in october <br />
that held rain<br />
because she's always crying<br />
&amp; i'm always feeling reflections of rainbows when she laughs<br />
i told the moon this <br />
&amp; she said <i>thank you</i><br />
&amp; turned me into stardust while you were pulling out <br />
your eyelashes unintentionally<br />
she climbed back into the sky<br />
with a sign the read<br />
the inverse of you<br />
is the universe <br />
i know that's not always enough</p>

<p><b>3.</b></p>
<p>please stop being beautiful in front of me because it is very hard to live when you are right next to a person, a beautiful one, like yourself. Mercury is spinning around us &amp; there are currently no plans but soon I will end up saying something like Maybe we should just elope &amp; you will say But my family needs to be there &amp; I will say We should buy a farm so your family can come visit us on it. you will ask What about your family &amp; I will open the window then ask Where are all the fucking seagulls? sometimes October rings inside my ears. sometimes I want to tell you I think it's time to start living like a tree before we turn into tables. you will give me a look like the look I give any child under two who can't tie their shoes &amp; I will say Don't worry, I promise to be better just after I press my hand into some wet soil.</p>

<p><b>4.</b></p>
<p>here is a love letter to my body / thank you for fixing me up when I fall on a hard sidewalk &amp; also fuck you for making me cry in every single bathroom / this is starting to get beautiful / &amp; fuck anyone who thinks saying the word beautiful in a poem is wrong / this is a poem for the beautiful people who have felt like they were wrong / for everyone who still has caterpillar skin watching butterflies laugh around them / butterflies so light they can land on a person's nose / yeah /  a nose / for everyone waiting patiently to be able to fly / clothes aren't gendered so why don't you go fuck yourself / i'm waiting for different colors to turn into me</p>

          <div><p>Something floats along my eye, its gone now<br />
Something floats along the Eagle Nebula<br />
This object&rsquo;s light diffuses across the memory of a long night<br />
It can be seen reflected in the waxed linoleum floors of<br />
The (now closed) Pathmark off North Broad Street<br />
<br />
Turn off the florescent lights, then imagine&nbsp;<br />
Gliding across the Pillars of Creation in a<br />
Chrome shopping cart<br />
<br />
Back on earth, dust will fill the shadows of my hands<br />
As the two form prayers<br />
Underneath a clinic&rsquo;s unassuming drop ceiling<br />
<br />
Riding the bus, thinking about rough knuckles,<br />
Hairy pits, and morning breath<br />
Rereading messages, occasionally<br />
Looking out the windows/imagining the self<br />
Something unrealized but fulfilling<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;No answer, except acceptance&rdquo; &ndash; they say to me as I walk out<br />
<br />
Any minor gloom will turn the slim comfort of this<br />
Distracting peasouper into a bed without pillows<br />
So memorize the expression&nbsp;I make before saying &ldquo;maybe&rdquo; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; As sand shoots up into the mesosphere, becomes glass,<br />
And rains back down&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Capture the smell of this world ending in fire and remain cautious<br />
Of shiny, yet sharp, things that only mirror the worst angles</p>

i remember that brain melting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;boy that brain bursting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but that was not like this<br />
my blood being blessed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the tiny rivers the conduits ride between<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the earth and the world right next to it and the worlds right next to it<br />
burn holes to flow through all of them<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all ride rivers of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neurotoxic elixirs, love, these hemotoxins in my heart<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;run through me like<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;oceans don&#39;t flow<br />

<br />
in you<br />
stretch like string fields bend light<br />
priest, priestess<br />
i bang these stars slow motion out my eyes for you<br />
irises lost in this tide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i&#39;m absorbing all the light and everything that comes with it<br />
if you knew what it was like being this close to the edge of a waterfall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beating this hard<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you wouldn&#39;t speak<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it all ends up in the final water body<br />
<br />
every olive sea krait that glides<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just a connector to another place and another place and another place<br />
live coral reefs open to something else<br />
these Thai warriors touch knee to solar plexus<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fangs to blood vessels<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;send lightning through chests<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to awaken<br />
i can see what that awakening would look like if i stayed or if i went<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from here<br />
those west lips want to taste me in the sunset<br />
not the way i wanted you burned holes through me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this path to the skyline isn&#39;t like<br />
the boys left with big windows in their bodies<br />
i saw it happen when i was nine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blood those swamp bullets blow a man wide open to the sun<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(when i was ten my brother fell from the sky and broke his skull)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not the same way the French are always so alone in caf&eacute;s with their friends and in movies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and i left you in that bar by yourself in Montreal with your family<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i still have poison in me from that night: the who was i and the how could i that won&rsquo;t leave<br />
but that bite<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bent me backward over my spine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;back around sacral<br />
<br />
ii.<br />

you walked toward me so tentatively<br />
(the cervical balances the big egg brain so perilously)<br />
said you would pounce on my scare if you ever saw it,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;glimpsing it almost never<br />
it&#39;s always there for you,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it&#39;s always there for you,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it catches light in a different way since i don&#39;t fear the fire<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i was ready for the injection<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;every initiation is a death<br />

<br />
iii.<br />
<br />
priest, priestess<br />
these stars that i bang out my palms for you<br />
explode as questions<br />
what happens when all the little deaths converge into one big death<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is it the same but grander<br />
does the flame flicker in the cosmic socket and not return<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what do you want to know<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the poets today are afraid to sing stories<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that can rob me of my faces and my phrases if i get too close<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these aren&rsquo;t just words<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i&rsquo;m right here<br />

what is really me starting to perfuse timeless lips<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inexorably wet like when you have no choice but to start a family<br />

Two women are building a house<br />
around a dying animal.<br />
They go to the river<br />
&amp; dig up clay<br />
to make into bricks<br />
they bake in an oven.<br /><br />

The bricks stack up high.<br />
Four, five deep.<br />
The walls are thick.<br />
They leave space for a window.<br />
They leave space for a door.<br /><br />

They finish the house<br />
&amp; the animal says<br />
thank you so much<br />
but I am still dying.<br /><br />

Love,<br />
Sara</p>

<p><b>dear hairless hairless tiny teacup pig playing a piano,</b><br /><br />
Your song gives me chills.<br />
&amp; the piano you've got sounds<br />
just like the feeling I had riding<br />
the train into this bright city<br />
for the first time &amp; so often since.<br />
Where did you get your piano?<br />
Because the notes all remind me<br />
of people I know, people I knew,<br />
&amp; of these beautiful intersecting lines<br />
they draw across my field of vision,<br />
these single words that I don't<br />
know the meanings of, but know<br />
the feelings of, &amp; how they move<br />
with me when I turn my head<br />
or walk down the street or kiss<br />
a person other than the one<br />
I wish I was kissing.<br /><br />

Hairless, it feels like you<br />
are putting your whole hands<br />
in my wounds.<br />
It feels like a dream<br />
about your family<br />
where everyone dies.<br />
One you can't stop having,<br />
that strangers quote<br />
at you on the street,<br />
that is projected<br />
on the wall<br />
in your favorite<br />
restaurant.<br /><br />

Pig, can we stop now?<br />
I love your song, it's true,<br />
I can't stop looking at it,<br />
but I am tired of feeling for now.<br />
Let's sleep quietly on our stomachs<br />
&amp; hope everything's changed<br />
by the time we wake up.<br /><br />

Love always,<br />
Sara</p>

Homeowners continue their calls. They press fingers into screens a bit more forcefully.</p><br /><br />

<p>An ear bud turns into a miner inside my ear.<br />
He is drinking water from a canteen, talking to someone on a cell.<br />
I can feel his head getting sweaty. His voice is raspy.<br /><br />
The interior loosens and something gold appears.<br />
The gold shakes like an agitated tiger <br />
and the miner swings his axe, cracking the gold in two.<br /><br />
He eats both pieces; the chewing echoes<br />
until the lonesome feast concludes. Then he immolates.<br />
He slams his fiery hands into the floor of my ear<br />
and screams; I cannot look anywhere.<br /><br />
Jerking violently, he becomes a miniature sun<br />
and flows freely through my body as if I were a ghost.<br /><br />
And sitting wherever he wants in me, sensing my weaknesses, he projects<br />
from his ten thousand flaming mouths an afternoon<br />
in which I am completely stupid and what-the-fuck about everything.</p>

          <div><p>1<br /><br />

From above, the city is a collection of abstract shapes – squares, rectangles, triangles – and colours, greys, greens, yellows, browns. The closer you get, the abstract takes shape. You begin to see patterns, activities, people, people in suits, jeans, shorts, t-shirts, people happy, sad, desperate. One or two people realise that the buildings are not enough in this city. It seems they are looking through the buildings and out to the endless agoraphobic desert. Eyeballs seem to be coming out of their heads and these people look as if they have developed twitch muscle fibers more advanced than others. They want to jump from the outside to the inside, as if the limitless space of the desert will swallow them whole. They crave the dark of the gambling room, the brothel, the bar.<br /><br />

2<br /><br />

The interior of the motel room is bright. There are no windows, but instead an abundance of artificial light. And inside the room, a bed, a side table, a bible, a telephone, tiled floor, nuclear white tiles, same as the walls. From the outside, notice that the room is located away from the main road to avoid traffic noise. Also notice that the room is close to the car park, the pool, the patio, for quick escapes, relaxing or perhaps dying. <br /><br />

3<br /><br /> 

There he was, sitting at the bar. A soft light just above his head, like he was on a stage playing a part. His head was bigger than the rest of his body, like an onion. The body of a child, somebody said. A regular, so people knew him, or at least knew his body and his head and pitied him, treated him kindly. His face looked like a child’s too, but as if all the moisture had been sucked out of it, leaving it dry and sad. All alcoholics have big heads, said another regular. They all look like turnips.<br /><br />

I sat next to him and observed his hands. Fine hands, probably hadn’t seen a days work in their life. What’s your name, I asked and he said Felix though this probably wasn’t true. I asked him what he was drinking. He ran his finger across the dark wood of the bar like he was about to taste it and said take me driving.<br /><br />

We got in the car and drove around for a few hours. It was his car. He said look at that: a television in the middle of the street. Later, we saw an animal that looked like a feral dog. It disappeared through a tear in a fence and scarpered off through a used car parts lot.<br /><br />

We eventually went back to a large house, a mansion, and went inside. There were butlers, flowers taller than a grown man, carpets, a projector, a monkey in a cage.<br /><br />

We eventually made love in a room with four windows, one looking north, one east, south and west. He was spent and looked like jogging-clothes that had been taken off in a hurry.<br /><br />

4<br /><br />

The elderly feed ducks in pairs. The ducks feed the elderly alone, with greater urgency. Some of the elderly don’t leave their homes. They stay at home and moan about the past versus the present. Others moan about their dead husbands, wives, children, pets. One man complains about his missing legs. They were blown off in the war over 70 years ago and he still misses them.<br /><br />

But sometimes, at night, the elderly roam the city dressed as young people. The makeup on their faces is thick and caked and they move with terrifying gait, like a contortionist being filmed in reverse. They do all the things they did as youngsters, but slower and with more precision, with knowledge and cycnicism. For example, the ‘neck’ and then complain about stinking mouths and hairy tongues. They go to watch movies at drive-ins but they are blind.<br /><br />

The others just walk, walk and walk and walk and count – one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight and so on – until they eventually drop dead.<br /><br />

The limousine drivers all wear black and go to the same parties. They all at the same diner and order the same food. Their arteries are similarly ruined. They drink together, too, when they have finished their shifts and arguments break out. <br /><br />

-   Your face is shit all day.<br />
-   I am going to tear out your heart and fuck it. <br />
-   Your wife has a big dick and it’s brown and yellow.<br /><br />

And so on. <br /><br />

You don’t bet on horses. You bet on other animals, smaller animals. This way you make more money, and maybe you can buy a meal, maybe two, a bottle of wine too. Dogs, you see, nobody thinks about dogs. It’s always horses. But if you bet on dogs, maybe you get more – more than if you went with horses. And after, you go out, you get a drink. You come onto a woman who looks like your mother and you feel sick because even though she looks like your mother, you’re desperate and you try and forget her face but the word ‘forget’ is too weak so you search for a more suitable word – unremember, you say, stupidly – and you try and graft another face onto her existing face, but it doesn’t work – she’s the double of your mother, your mother before she died, cancer, beautiful, eyes, mouth, cheeks, hair. You take your mother home and you have sex with her and you feel sick but you can’t deny this is a good time and you think afterwards about the death of your mother and then you unremember that event and hug the woman next to you, a surrogate of some kind, a temporary version of your dead mother, you hug her and kiss her until a dull sun creeps into the misty sky and illuminates your motel room like a tired, half-assed light.

          <div><p><b>Fun War</b><br /><br />
she says ‘you are officially the first thing<br />
i think of,’ her mouth a line, as if<br />
i am condemned. i am so okay<br /><br />

with that. what was i just gonna say. a girl<br />
at my summer camp went to an alternative high school <br />
and wore tank tops because she wasnt worried about anybody seeing<br /><br />

rain speckles your face all silver when you tell me <br />
we both missed the deadline <br />
for the internship application. i think that it will be okay<br /><br />

but i am always wrong. a fortune teller gleans <br />
out of a glass orb<br />
a future you disagree with. <br />
i dont have to know what happens to know<br /><br />

i disagree with the traffic light on a night <br />
she and i are in the backseat<br />
together, both internally warring over whether or not <br />
to place a hand<br />
you said it’s not too late for me but to be careful<br />
i said ‘with what’<br />
you said ‘be careful’ <br />
&amp; my brain turned <br />
to a claw clasping &amp; unclasping <br />
until you texted back with more clarity <br /><br />

i don’t think i feel like it<br />

i want her to think i am a whimsical person<br />
but i don’t have any posters in my room right now and it resembles an asylum<br /><br />

i think, i don’t know<br />
i’ve never seen one from the inside<br />
next time she comes over<br />
i will tell her that</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>

<p><b>It Is In Everyone’s Best Interest</b><br /><br />

i liked her instantly because she had a picture of her mom as her profile picture<br />
there are only erratic ways to measure tenderness &amp; i think that’s how<br />
it should feel when someone is bashful in an honest way, not just<br />
because it’s cute and fun to draw people<br />
closer to the person they would be if no one had ever said anything<br />
when you are in the room i feel it in my back teeth as a kind of metallic ringing, <br />
chewing on the aluminum of you saying hi to other people first <br />
it is impossible not to fall in love with someone when they tell you the story<br />
of the afternoon they stood in their backyard looking small above<br />
the acorns littering the lawn, moving again and again<br />
the hair from their face<br />
it is impossible not to fall in love<br />
at one point or another, but you have to try not to<br />
ruin your perception of each other in this way; i idealize girls into gods<br /><br />

and feel betrayed when they can’t enact a flood whenever i want &amp; <br />
boys and girls do this to me &amp; boys and girls do this to each other &amp; boys<br />
&amp; boys pull at each other to see who makes more of a predator &amp; girls<br />
&amp; girls pull at each other to see if anyone really loves anyone for the inside<br />
i click through her profile pictures and wish we could be friends but<br />
there are only insolent ways to distract yourself, or i always<br />
feel so kind from a distance</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>

<p><b>Whenever Someone Asks If I’ve Been Skinny Dipping I Say Yes But I Haven’t</b><br /><br />
depending on how far you zoom out it is easier to absorb any sized tragedy<br />
i havent watched the news in two months<br />
you cant make me <br /><br />

i have enough to fear &amp; tread above<br />
not frantic, just moving<br />
so as to avoid touching the awful slimy thing w/ my foot<br />
or whatever else is at the bottom of a lake so big<br /><br />

it’s been a while since i’ve seen you and you were not happy to see me<br />
i’m not mad, i know you’ve been busy organizing your future by color<br />
it’s just another thing to notice<br />
get my head wet last, wait til everyone else goes first<br />
but generally someone has to dunk me, two open hands <br />
on my shoulders &amp; laughter that blurs once underwater <br /><br />

longer i hold my breath down here the more<br />
my lungs fill with steel, cold tug &amp; shrapnel<br />
you sent me a series of snapchats of you at ArtSpace in Hartford<br />
i am uncultured and didn’t understand what i was looking at <br />
but i liked the exhibit with all the red bowls<br />
full of red flowers</p>

          <a href="/december2015/2016/03/19/6.html"><h3 class="contrast">Your Bed In Tokyo</h3></a>
          <br><span class="smaller">by Jim Walls on March 19, 2016</span>  <br/>
          <div><p>I didn’t tell you that it had nothing to do with you although I did do it because I knew I could stay in your bed in Tokyo. I didn’t tell you that it took 8 days for my family to figure out I wasn’t in America anymore.<br /><br />

You didn’t know all the reasons why I flew across the ocean so far that it became a different day. You didn’t know why I got fired from my job or why I used all my savings to buy a round trip ticket and that I didn’t plan on going home. You didn’t know that I wasn’t on vacation.<br /><br />

We spent a lot of time watching movies on your laptop on your bed with your cat. Most of the time we were talking more than watching. I suggested that we buy tickets to this place I had read about on the internet called the Suicide Forest. I said:<br /><br />

“Not to do it together. Just to see it.”<br /><br />

So we bought tickets for at the end of September. At the beginning of September I ran out of money but I cancelled my return flight anyway. And on the night my flight left without me I got into bed naked with you and you took off your clothes too. The day after that we started fighting. You later admitted you felt hurt about reproached advances when you told me:<br /><br />

“You think you’re above the law of the way things work.”<br /><br />

You resented funding what you saw as my vacation but you continued to pay for my food and alcohol and cigarettes and share half of your bed with me even though we never fucked again after the first time. But we still slept naked and I still watched you get dressed every morning. I later claimed I was only drunk when I yelled:<br /><br />

“Everyone hates me because I can’t love them.”<br /><br />

And it started to become clear that we wouldn’t make it to the Suicide Forest together. I started going out at night and waking up on the sidewalk. You started planning a backpacking trip through southeast Asia. The idea of you traveling for a month alone through third world countries seemed unlikely to me. I said:<br /><br />

“You won’t be able to talk to anyone for a month.”<br /><br />

And then I realized I wouldn’t either. You said:<br /><br />

“I’ve traveled abroad before. I think I got it.”<br /><br />

I hated that you used the word abroad. I said:<br /><br />

“I guess only rich people get poor countries.”<br /><br />

I didn’t believe you would actually go until I found an envelope full of yen on your bed and a note that said:<br /><br />

-Please don’t let my cat die.<br />

When I dropped the note was when I first thought about what death might be like. It could be a screen that displayed “oops over” for 5 seconds in size 12 font and then went blank forever. I imagined your body covered in rat-sized bugs as it floated down a river in the Cambodian jungle and then:<br /><br />

-Oops over.<br /><br />

And when I saw people in the street who I could never talk to because they didn’t speak my language and I didn’t speak theirs I thought to myself:<br /><br />

-Oops over.<br /><br />

I wished I had the power to see inside them instead of the power to imagine them dead. And then I thought:<br /><br />

-There’s too many people in this world.<br /><br />

That was the thought that made me drop the cigarette that burned the little crater in your cat’s ear. Her eyes reflected back at me with a yowl when I tried to reach under the bed to pet her. She couldn’t understand the concepts of accident, apology, regret. So I let her outside and she never came back.<br /><br />

When my sister found out I was in Japan she had sent me an email. Part of it said:<br /><br />

-Cutting out the things that you think are making you unhappy won’t make you happier but I guess you’re getting closer to the problem.<br /><br />

I read this again while on the bus to the Suicide Forest. The weather was gray and on the horizon I saw 2 dark slopes rising to meet each other before getting lost in the clouds. I thought it might be the base of Mt. Fuji but I had never seen a mountain before so I couldn’t believe that it could be that big and I tried to email my sister:<br /><br />

-Tell dad I’m ok.<br /><br />

But my phone died and behind my eyelids was my name displayed in size 6 font.<br /><br />

Inside the Suicide Forest was all green moss coating everything and when I went in far enough I could barely hear anything at all. I forgot to buy a ticket back to Tokyo and I didn’t even know where I was. I was inside the Suicide Forest near the base of maybe Mt. Fuji. Even when it started getting dark it seemed unlikely to me that I could get myself killed while traveling in the first world.<br /><br />

But inside my head were 3 mental images:<br /><br />

-The envelope full of yen on your bed in Tokyo.<br /><br />

-My dad’s blue truck in Delaware.<br /><br />

-You pulling on your briefs while holding a lit cigarette.<br /><br />

And these things felt like they were dissolving into a blank screen. By the time the sun rose I was still in the Suicide Forest near the base of what was probably Mt. Fuji but I felt like I was barely there at all.

          <br><span class="smaller">by Ricky Garni on March 19, 2016</span>  <br/>
          <div><p>I would like to build a movie of your life that lasted a lifetime. And this life follows another.  And that life follows this. Therefore a lifetime would be forever. I am ready to make this movie. I am ready to watch this movie. And now I will. And so I will go. I am ready. I think you will be happy. It’s time for us to enjoy the rest of our lives. For the movie to begin.  Just look at the curtains, how wonderful they are, how they open like birds at a window, dying to be outside.</p>

<p><b>I Declare</b><br /><br />

If you say I love you enough, it sounds just like a rock skipping on a frozen lake, which you would think would sound really sharp and hard, but it actually sounds just like mallard ducks looking for little fish under the ice of a frozen lake.

“I love you,” the mallard ducks say to the little fish, frozen in the lake.

          <br><span class="smaller">by Brittany Swenson on March 19, 2016</span>  <br/>
          <div><p>Doom trickles. Is it sweat? A cold perspiration? A delusion. Stabbed by realness. Blade serving as a medium. But the blade is a butter knife. Not to be taken seriously. Don’t misconstrue a few scratches for a gauging wound. Don’t let this medium belittle you. Yet here I am on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Crybaby. Not nurtured properly. My mother was 23 when she had me. She could hardly nurture herself. Much less another human being. Compassion emits. As does resentment. Eddy of fusions. Seeing the line of division. Between self and self. They’re possessed by hate. It is this division which connects them. A shot of adrenaline jets upward. Jolted to extremities. When the external resource takes hold. Curse the hold. Never asked for it consciously. Maybe unconsciously. I did. What is this insane mirage known as Here and Now? As if we were flippantly thrown, a few crumbs to the wind, God ruffles It’s coat to It’s comfort – the wind is provoking a chill of some sort. Pigeons peck at me. For I am a mound of crumbling selves. Stomp me out. For the love of God stomp me out. Crush me into complacency. Maybe then I’d be okay.</p>

<p>I give forth to these images. Oblique and indifferent. The stare of white makes me shiver. For it is through the blankness that I see. Validation of the sight. I guess that’s what this is. Thanks for the opening, there. That good ol’ clearing. Here’s a yawn for every revelatory moment. Not even tired. But I figured I’d throw in a yawn. Because why not. Encompassing attitude: ‘why not?’ Death? Why not? Birth? Why not? Pain? Why not? Confidence? Why not? Truth? Why not? Maya? Why not? The senses peer in on themselves. Leaning in on their own secrets. Huffy breaths I’d imagine. Smelly and heavy. The feel of when a secret secretes itself upon the earlobe. Another shiver. Picture that. It does make sense. In a way. Numbers are not relevant here. No tally. No markup. No error. The error is of the whole thing, I think. Miraculous error. The joy of human constructs.</p>

<p>Oh, but I am on the run. On the run. On the run. Okayness is all I long for. I’m a child of the moon. A Cancer Goddammit. Ruled by the question of security. Ruled by the need to find home. To find home in sentences. To find home in touch. To find home in friendship. Think of the emotional validity behind father’s words. Inherent self entitlement – but not in the form of narcissism. I admire him. Grew up in the streets. Plagued. These streets are still smeared with dirt. And angry faces. Fucking miserable city, New York. Romanticize the gloom. This has been home. Gloom comes natural, here. The cramped shuffling. The gray and its gallop. It shuts this bravery like a clam. I wish I could live in bed.</p>

          <br><span class="smaller">by Ron Gibson on March 18, 2016</span>  <br/>
          <div><p>As I stood on the deck of a ferry, wind against my face, slicing<br />
through dark waters under blue sky, I thought about things on the<br />
borderlands of possible and impossible, like digitally-manipulated<br />
art. You seemed to be all around me: in the giggles of children, in<br />
the conversation of lovers, in the cries of hungry seagulls, as they<br />
conducted aerial maneuvers for alms.</p>

<p>I thought about beginnings and endings, and yesterdays and nows and<br />
tomorrows, and I could feel you there, a presence just beyond the<br />
periphery. Everything shouted, but only I could hear your name in the<br />
thick throats, in the sea hiss, in the engine rumble. I heard you<br />
somewhere over the Olympic mountain range, past the mountain goats<br />
past the snowcaps; you were where the sun lays down to die, and I<br />
thought of you dreaming by its side, content, full of love and loved<br />
in full.</p>

<p>Later, in the ferry terminal, I read fictional constructs from another<br />
time, from another place, and there was a certain heat in their<br />
fictional lives that felt familiar, that felt reflective of us,<br />
without actually being us.</p>

<p>I tried to explain to myself what ‘was,’ but still could not explain<br />
what ‘is.’ It was some foreign word on the tongue without translation;<br />
a novel not yet fully conceived; it was a song yet to be heard by<br />
ears, and it was the sonic boom that filled the skies with your<br />
pounding heart, as metal spires loomed into view on the horizon,<br />
growing larger and larger with your bright welcomes, until the sight<br />
was more than any one man could take.</p>

          <br><span class="smaller">by Hilton Hosannah on March 18, 2016</span>  <br/>
          <div><p>Gregory woke up, hungry and broke, not having eaten in four days. He got up from the bed, poured 180 proof Bacardi rum and San Pellegrino on top of ice cubes in a Solo cup, and then lit a half­finished cigarillo laying in the windowsill. The cell phone charging next to his pillow went off less that twenty minutes later; he shut it off and opened the Bank of America app. The money hadn’t come yet. A long drag of the cigarillo could soothe hunger pains but was also harsh on the throat, so Gregory punctuated each with a sharp swig from the cup. He didn’t like smoking and had quit cold turkey a week ago; a YouTube video of Christopher Hitchens, extolling the austerity found after a few puffs, coaxed him back. It only cost a dollar from the convenience store down the street to get a cigarillo, and he could make it another day without eating if he spread it out. Maybe he was just bad with money: the tip he left at Bonchon earlier in the week could have bought another week’s worth of cigarillos or half a handle of rum. Were his priorities in check? Was something wrong at home? Seems like you never think about things until they happen, Gregory thought to himself. He would text his mother, roll over in bed, and smoke and drink until he received an answer. If the money was in his account, he would leave the apartment and have a great day; if not, he would lay in bed and imagine he wasn’t so hungry. Maybe I should go to class today, Gregory thought. He threw the blanket over his head and closed his eyes. His brain felt tired. He heard the phone vibrate, opened one eye, and saw the soft green light blinking, like a distress call, in the darkness under the sheets. He checked his account and then imagined he wasn’t so hungry.</p>

          <div><p>p&gt;In the ocean trench of your dream, a version of yourself and I stretch a pun over fire, too consumed with survival to roast it to perfection. Together, we whisper to keep our arms from floating away. I remember how my voice shattered like glass and sank, how it continues to sink and sink, every piece running an impossible marathon against the others. In the end, no one has prepared you for the malice in the deep. We keep rings around our foreheads to hold it intact. Bloody pools in our bodies like headless horsemen. A phantom kite tied into the hopscotch of our ankles. A new animal whose skin is teeth that do not gnaw but molt and grow again. In the beginning, I tried so hard to learn the art of whistling.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p><b>dreamwear</b></p>

<p>In the church of your dream, a group of people is clustered together near the pulpit, wearing a similar-looking werewolf helmet matted with tears that did not come from their eyes, talking quietly with a scribbled whisper that isn’t coming from their mouths. A version of yourself walks in. “Why are you all wearing werewolf helmets?” You ask. “What, you didn’t bring your werewolf helmet?” They respond in unison. “No, what’s a werewolf helmet?” A boy revolves from the group like a shard of mirror. “The werewolf helmet does something different for everyone. The werewolf helmet hides the craters of light in Megan’s face; the werewolf helmet cools &amp; protects the desert brush in Johnny’s mouth; the werewolf helmet keeps Stanley’s diamond-cut bone structure from being scratched; the werewolf helmet takes Melissa’s head to another world, like an oasis on Mars; for me, the werewolf helmet carries
my eyes into a sky in the ocean, it makes me feel calm, held, unafraid. What would the werewolf helmet do for you? If my eyes weren’t deep inside my own werewolf helmet, I would tell you, because no one can see their own face—the mirror never tells the whole truth, just cuts it open and watches it bleed out. Go get a werewolf helmet and never take if off. Come back when we know for certain that you know for certain there’s something you want hidden, and that your werewolf helmet prevents any chance of us seeing it.” The boy revolves back into the group, sealing it shut. You go and exchange all of your jewelry for your own werewolf helmet, but when you come back, the group has shattered across the room, facing different directions. In the multicolored moonglow through the stained-glass window, you can see their heads alive and snapping like a wolf’s, their skin sharp and obsidian. At the center of the circle they had once made, a body lies torn, its insides pure and glass like a petrified chunk of wood. When you put on your werewolf helmet, all you see is a three-dimensional dark, fluid and optimistic, like a lie. From inside, you hear the wolves’ breathing move closer to you until you become the center of their circle, swimming under.</p>

<p><b>dreamvault</b></p>
<p>A list of items in the underground vault of your dream: 
•   a blind cough

•   a party of metallic hats, stray jackets, an athlete’s left crutch, my videogame manual from years ago 
•   the alphabet unraveling into something primordial, like

•   animal meat on the floor, so old 
o   that it’s becoming an invention

<p><b>dreamstone</b></p>

<p>In the clearing outside the small town of your dream, Viktor Shklovsky argues with stones. He wants them to be more like themselves (for the young artist’s sake) stonier than they ever were or ever will be. He’s opening his hands to read aloud the thousands of words etched into his palms, but he seems to be speaking with more than one voice, projecting inwards, outwards, beyond the forest and all of its forests, like how a kaleidoscope creates ghosts of the same color. He conjures pompoms and begins to cheer the stones on. S-T-O-N-E! Eventually, Shklovsky becomes such a dedicated fan that he curls into a stone himself. Oh, he says, now I am the stoniest of all. Imagine: a talking stone. It’s a spectacle. A couple from the small town discovers it talking to itself and reports to the mayor, who demands a stage be built around stone-Shklovsky and its frightening glory. The town begins charging a fee for anyone who wants to stop by and chat, making a fortune off tourists intrigued by the stone’s intelligence. Now, the town can afford to clean up the public transit and even bring in a Chipotle. Everyone begins to see things as more than just a classification; they see the city of veins in everything. Suddenly, Shklovsky’s speech is reduced to nouns and articles—A box. A chair.—but it’s okay because everyone knows what he means. No one is angry. But, over a span of days, he transforms back into human Viktor Shklovsky, retaining the nature of the stone—holding still, not talking. Despite the change, everyone still sees him as a stone, though tourism does begin to dwindle a bit. The small town reclines back into a state of drowsiness, while Shklovsky stands, even now, as stony as ever, the town’s citizens stopping by now and again to have a picnic in the clearing, or to sit next to him and enjoy a nice reflective silence, staring ahead and mouthing tiny words, Shklovsky, all the while, not saying one. He no longer needs to.</p>

<p><b>dreamhunger</b></p>

<p>In the badlands of your dream, a man cups a tiny, beached whale in his palm, taking a tiny spoon to its innards, grating along the dark pink meat, snapping the ribs up like seeds that failed to glimmer. “This is mine,” he says to himself, “I found it.”</p>

          <br><span class="smaller">by Emily Sipiora on March 18, 2016</span>  <br/>
          <div><p>A grating, raucous noise was the first thing Audrey noticed when she woke up this afternoon. It was 1PM– outside of her window, it was dull, gray, and frigid. On the ground, little bits of frost crystallized on the grass. Audrey sat up to properly look out of the window, and watched barely formed flurries collect on the sidewalk’s surface. It seemed that the weather took a negative turn last night– if she recalled correctly, it had been barely chilly the day before. Her fingers traced along her bed frame, looking for the source of the cacophony.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a cell phone vibrating against the headboard. It wasn’t her roommate entering in a drunken clamor. What could it have been? Something in the air felt off. It was a little too chilly, a bit too quiet for the norm. Usually, Audrey woke up to the sound of her upstairs neighbors’ dog excitedly pattering around, yelping about some grand excitement Audrey didn’t care to understand.</p>
<p>Was the dog gone today? Audrey listened, only to find that her entire surrounding was eerily silent. Maybe the neighbors took it for a walk. The girl decided that the neighbors must have taken the noisy animal out. She tried to enjoy the silence, but it didn’t work.</p>
<p>After a few moments had passed, Audrey began to feel strange, slanted– everything appeared filtered, sickly green, rotating slowly like a defunct merry go round. Audrey chalked up her discomfort to sleep paralysis. It was biological and regular, she promised herself.</p>
<p>Water– water is what she needed. Audrey hoisted herself out of bed, into the kitchen, where she poured herself a glass of water out of the kitchen sink. Finally. 
Audrey drank the water, noting that it had a distinctly rusty tang to it. For now, Audrey chose to ignore it.</p>
<p>Moving back into her bedroom, the light had grown a little stronger and illuminated the entire room. As she sat down, Audrey’s eyes fell to the glass that she held, and she realized that the water was brown– hence, the rusty and terrible flavor. It tasted of copper and salt.</p>
<p>Alarm immediately struck her, and she put the glass down without saying anything in order to catch her breath. It wasn’t brown, it was red. No– brown, Audrey told herself. It was brown. This was an isolated incident, she told herself. It was well water. It wasn’t what it looked like. It wouldn’t– no, couldn’t– happen again.</p>
<p>II. “An unpleasant but necessary preparation for the afterlife where, alone, man could expect to enjoy happiness.”</p>
<p>Once Audrey looked closer at Jonathan, she noticed a few odd things about his appearance. That nasty green spinning sensation struck her again when she looked at him. Jonathan had a split lip. A faint black eye. Something damaged in his hunched shoulders and cautious gaze. Audrey decided that he was alluring, but sinister. Something appeared to be wrong with him. The same thing was probably wrong with her. 
“I’m sorry about the accident,” Jonathan said.</p>
<p>Audrey did not reply. She began to shudder, uncertain of why she felt so chilled to the bone, but something in Jonathan’s voice frightened her to her very core. Audrey had no idea what he was talking about, but she knew it was terrifying and serious.</p>
<p>“Did it hurt for you?” Jonathan asked her.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Audrey breathed, suddenly feeling a squeezing pain in her chest. “I don’t know what is happening right now.”</p>
<p>“It’s not sleep paralysis, Audrey,” Jonathan wheezed, holding his sides and inclining towards her. “It’s something much more serious.”</p>
<p>“Jonathan, I don’t know what the hell you are talking about,” Audrey retorted.</p>
<p>The way that his fingers rapped against the kitchen table reminded Audrey of something eerie that happened the previous morning– a loud, scraping noise, like Atlas carelessly dropped the burdens of the world right into Audrey’s apartment.</p>
<p>Audrey tried to read the electric clock on the dining room wall, but the numbers were foggy and illegible. Audrey briefly thought that she was dreaming, but after hearing an alarming coughing noise, she turned to see Jonathan making jerky movements as the rapping of his fingers grew faster. Audrey’s vision became more fractured.</p>
<p>Her sights were picturesque: breaking glass, screeching noises, people stepping on her fingers on accident and asking her if she was okay. Audrey realized that she was on the ground at this time, trying to roll onto her side but failing because that part of her body didn’t work. She recognized Jonathan’s coat next to her, sitting crumpled and defeated next to a piece of shrapnel on the concrete they spilt themselves on.</p>
<p>Audrey regained her sight in a few minutes, feeling more disoriented than she had before. Looking outside Jonathan’s window, she saw that snow covered every inch of his backyard. Little flakes of cold, white death spread out over his home. It was getting colder outside. It was cold inside, too. Audrey was certain that it was winter now.</p>
<p>Audrey could barely see the silhouette of Jonathan, who now appeared to be shaking without reason. Audrey felt something warm spill against the fabric of her sweater. It was thick, hot, and musky. Little bits of viscera sat in Audrey’s lap. She began to realize that pieces of herself and Jonathan were what stained her jeans.</p>
<p>Audrey felt the unstable other reassure herself in her head– it wasn’t anything personal– it was just a car accident. It was just an accident. It was nobody’s fault. In that moment of clarity, Audrey noticed just how blatantly desolate it looked outside.</p>
<p>III. “He shall have driven her back to Hell.”   Audrey woke up in her bed again, mistaking the thumping upstairs for her own heart. It seemed that the neighbors had brought their dog back home again. As she got out of bed to start her day, that disorientation came back around again, but this time it was different– it felt familiar, like she had dealt with it for years before this.</p>
<p>It was like a lukewarm, sopping blanket that bogged her down to the floor of her apartment. When she walked to the kitchen table, she felt inside pieces of herself separating, and she didn’t feel that great, but she didn’t feel that terrible, either. It just felt like her insides were broken, detached, like the only thing keeping her organs inside of her was her external skin. She supposed that was what happened when you die in a car accident. Audrey felt in between, as if she existed in between life and death, not really participating in much of either, only bouncing between them.</p>
<p>Eternally, undisputedly between. Audrey looked outside the window, realizing that the outside world was drowning in the same winter as before when she was with Jonathan. The only visible sight was a billboard, one that she hadn’t seen before. Audrey squinted, attempting to read what it said. Finally, her vision focused, and she read the billboard’s text aloud to herself: “No exit.”</p>
<p>After realizing what had just happened, Audrey was immediately overtaken by a sadness hotter than any living person could bear.</p>

          <br><span class="smaller">by Christopher Morgan on February 15, 2016</span>  <br/>
          <div><p><img alt="Tables Without Chairs" src="http://alienmouth.com/reviews/tables.png" style="width:350px;height:350px" /></p>

<p>Released late last year from House of Vlad, &ldquo;Tables Without Chairs #1&rdquo; throws its readers face-first into an carnival experience courtesy of Bud Smith and Brian Alan Ellis. Combining recurring characters and shout-outs with uncanny art by Waylon Thornton, this book intersperses quips and self-reflection to paint its wild collage. From the get-go, readers find the duo exchanging cover band ideas before moving to hilarious blurbs such as: &ldquo;Brian Alan Ellis is like a scratch-off lottery ticket that you get for Christmas and HOLY SHIT I JUST WON $250 but your aunt who you owe $400 to is sitting right there so you hand it over and now it&rsquo;s fresh in her mind that you still owe $150 FUCK! But he writes really good stories&rdquo; (7). Besides clearly having a blast with the whole project, these writers manage to blend their respective styles of humor without ever losing speed, resulting in a lighthearted mood of leaking hot tubs and hellacious half-friends that continues to surprise.</p>

<p>A dark turntable celebration in the face of desertion, Brian Alan Ellis&rsquo;s first half, &ldquo;Sexy Time in the Spook House, Oh Yeah!&rdquo; kick-starts the show with a werewolf of a fellow on the rebound. Both resisting and seeking sexy times &ldquo;for this nightmare to scare us both awake&rdquo; (27), Ellis&rsquo;s main character hangs himself on the words of others, remembering his lost lover. Yet from this chaotic violence where &ldquo;Nobody is good to one another. Nobody is good to anyone&rdquo; (35), Ellis shifts gears entirely in his second section.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha-Ha! Sad Laughter&rdquo; unfolds as an anti-literary litany, unloading non-stop cynicism and what-ifs to take on postal submissions, Goodreads trolling, and the #amwriting hashtag, among others. Rather than simply attacking the literary establishment with an outsider&rsquo;s shallow contempt, Ellis confronts the scene&rsquo;s sacred cows with an insider&rsquo;s irony. Across thirty pages of fragments, we find suggestions for poetry readings at EDM raves, rejected submissions for a 25-words-only short story contest, 4 pages of pre-written blurbs, and other gems for making it big: &ldquo;When at AWP, a productive thing to do is to frantically ask random people if they know what time Smash Mouth goes on&rdquo; (70). Striking the right balance between self-deprecation and smugness, Brian Alan Ellis makes us laugh with one-liners like &ldquo;Pop-Tart prize &gt; Pushcart Prize&rdquo; (58), while also bringing in relatable gloom from the writer&rsquo;s life, trading your first novel for Burger King Groupons or hearing, &ldquo;Good news: Your book just went into its third printing&mdash;meaning that it is print-on-demand and only three people have purchased it&rdquo; (70).</p>

<p>After Ellis&rsquo;s dark adventures and proposals for an &ldquo;MFA in creative hiding&rdquo; (80), Bud Smith brings readers into &ldquo;Calm Face,&rdquo; ten stories of everyday moments imbued with a kind of smooth wonder. Sometimes you forget your badge for work during a hectic morning commute, but everything falls into place so you don&rsquo;t miss 30 minutes of pay (and you manage to steal a 5 gallon jug of gas to boot)! Whether laughing with his wife on mushrooms during freezing late night walks, or watching somebody almost get run over because there&rsquo;s &ldquo;NO SUCH THING AS HOLDING SPOTS&rdquo; (96) in the world of big-city parking, Smith&rsquo;s characters wander through so many quick, random moments, making us laugh at their oddness. In fact, true to Smith&rsquo;s title, these characters somehow manage to keep calm in the face of an anxious world, just as the Zen-like main character from &ldquo;Apartment 13,&rdquo; talking about his neighbor:</p>
<p><br />
<br /></p>
<div class="inline_poem" style="text-align: justify">He goes on and on and yells, &ldquo;FUCKING BULLSHIT! MOTHER FUCKING SCUM SUCKING BULLSHIT!!!!&rdquo; It comes and goes for hours. I sometimes wonder what he screams about but figure it&rsquo;s probably just a video game. If it was anything else besides a video game, everyone in this apartment building would be dead. I&rsquo;ve seen the neighbor in the hall but have never mentioned the screaming, because, yeah, it&rsquo;s none of my business, he&rsquo;s home when he does it, he can scream. If it bothered me, I&rsquo;d mention that. But it doesn&rsquo;t. I imagine he&rsquo;s playing Battletoads and is at the lava Jet Ski board. Only thing it can be.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(110-11)<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

<p>Throughout his stories, Smith shows we can let everything build up until it gets scary, or we can strip down and submerge into your apartment-flooding hot tub when people start pounding on your door!</p>

<p>In a world of mental health days, 50 mousetraps in need of opening, and writer residencies where &ldquo;you stay where you are but you stop paying rent. The residency ends when your landlord calls the police&rdquo; (46), Brian Alan Ellis and Bud Smith are on a mission to kick ass and gather laughs, or die trying. These wild novellas serve up truths of heartbreak and drudgery with laidback charm&mdash;like a collision within a floor-shifting fun house, &ldquo;Tables Without Chairs #1&rdquo; keeps us smiling as it combines our monsters with the daily 9-to-5 grind.</p>

He descends the spiral staircase<br />
and follows the stone path<br />
laid out to the can. <br />
Well, no longer a can-<br />

with wheels. Late October,<br />
winter on the way.<br /><br />

He has a smoke in the alley.<br />
The neighborhood is dying-<br />
everyone is moving closer<br />
to downtown, closer <br />
to the ache of the city.<br />
He doesn&#39;t mind-<br />
popularity is unusable.<br /><br />

This row of Victorians<br />
used to be elegant, similar<br />
to the photograph of an actress<br />
long dead, or almost there.<br />
Only a matter of time before<br />
the block is bought up<br />
and leveled for something<br />
monstrous and profitable.<br /><br />

We must be brave when everything<br />
is taken away. He exhales<br />
and looks up to where<br />
the moon should be, but is not.<br />
His beard is more white<br />
than gray, his eyes<br />
more closed than open.</p>

<p>A muddy patch on Greyhound windows,<br />

mulling heat rash ruddy amongst<br />
the stomach pain swirls inky acidic<br />

left as unburned kindle, as untested steel,<br />
as chalkboard theory, as textbook framework.<br /><br />

Embrace of asphalt arms, the model<br />
sparkling monuments to welfare states past<br />
which guide as gilded wire to weary dawns<br />
forward in militia march of white faced<br />

Plastic cups, plates of precious silver,<br />

wash against each as sandshore rocks<br />
the barring remove of aparting ocean;<br />
as still as life mural painting, stand<br />

strangely humble,<br /><br />

as if you could meet anyone,<br />

You and I should make an affair,<br />

of Turkish butchers&#39; instrumental clatter,<br />
seeming soundtrack of Haringey<br /><br />

as if there could be anything,<br />
all desires,<br />
in off-beat pulse of gig space walls,<br /><br />

in the grandeur spiral of 8 million<br />
we sometimes find ourselves.<br /><br />

as two points alighting the same.</p>

          <div><p>ONE</p>

<p>when i was nineteen, or eighteen or twenty, my friends and i went to this party. some party in some strange basement-in-an-alley type place. the type of place we loved, where we felt like we were somewhere doing something. there was a show, some terrible band was playing terrible music. i will never remember who. that isn&#39;t important to this story though.</p>

<p>we all got idiotically drunk. the kind of drunk you look back on and wonder how you could ever act so free.</p>

<p>so idiotically drunk we took off our shirts. all of us. so drunk and dancing. so free so loud so uncaring. i had brought one of those idiotically large bottles of wine. you know the kind, the ones that look like regular wine bottles but magnified. i thought i was tough and dramatic. maybe free. anyway, no shirts, drunk, dancing. a friend i wanted to fuck took my idiot bottle of wine and took a idiotically large drink of it. he was an alcoholic. that isn&#39;t important to this story though. we kept dancing and he kept drinking. somehow my mouth violently collided with the bottom of the bottle. not purposely, mind you. very fucking accidentally. i remember it not being my fault and i&#39;m sure he remembers it not being his. anyway, it hurt. alot. i knew i wasn&#39;t going to like what happened when i ran my tongue across my teeth. and i didn’t. a significant chunk of one of my front teeth was gone. did i swallow it? was it on the ground? i remember my third or fourth thought immediately after it happened was to wonder if someone was going to find it on the sticky floor the next day.</p>

<p>a few weeks or perhaps a month or so later my mom came to pick me up to go to her house for something, maybe for a holiday. maybe it was autumn then. i don’t remember. i remember walking out of my apartment and through the garden. filled with dread. i walked to her car and said “Hi mom” and i&#39;ve always heard of people say how they &#39;could never forget the look on his/her/their face&#39; but i&#39;d never really believed it. my memory always has been spotty. but i remember that look. the look on her face when i opened my mouth and she saw my tooth. i don&#39;t think she looked at me again the entire time she was driving us home.</p>

<p>my parents paid to have it fixed. no daughter of theirs was going to walk around looking like that. i went to the dentist i&#39;d been seeing since i was a child. she asked me how my mother was, how my brother was liking college. she even remembered what college he was going to. he has always been a patient of hers as well. my whole family had been. she asked me how it had happened. i tried to make it sound casual “Well my friend accidentally hit me in the face with a giant bottle of wine ha ha.” it did not come off casual or ha ha. i don&#39;t think she talked the entire time she was making my teeth symmetrical again.</p>

<p>this happened four, or five or three, years ago. my teeth still look symmetrical and you can&#39;t tell one is half fake unless you examine them closely. i forget it ever happened most of the time. the only times i remember is on first dates when i use it as a conversation piece, or when i want to eat an apple. i&#39;m scared that if i bite into an apple my fake tooth bit will pop right off.</p>

<p>TWO</p>

<p>for three weeks straight i would wake up from dreams of my teeth crumbling in my mouth. the dreams would begin in a medley of scenarios, they never seemed specific enough to be worth remembering. then it would be the same, every time. i would run my tongue across my teeth and they wouldn&#39;t hold still, they would wiggle and feel frightening. i would then look in a mirror and bare my teeth to myself they would be unhappy shades of brown. sickly ambers and the muds of three-days-ago rains. horrified i would reach up to touch them. my fingers would meet bone and the teeth would just crumble crumble crumble at the slightest touch it looked like a roman ruin panic would overtake me as my mouth turned into the grounds of the parthenon.</p>

<p>when i wake i feel my teeth one by one, touching each as counting my eggs in my nest. not being able to avoid feeling as if athena was disappointed in me.</p>

<p>THREE</p>

<p>googling the family tree of zeus on a saturday night to find what goddess i could pretend to be that week. it hurt my head to read all the names and murders of such a tortured family.</p>

could tell about me from my corpse alone:<br /><br />

twenty-something / female / nailbiter<br />
a ham in the bedroom (groomed pubic hair)<br /><br />

poor circulation / chronic disease / purple knees<br />
eats amitriptyline, cyclobenzaprine, daily b.c.<br /><br />

forever not ready for... next of kin? forget it<br />
just a long procession of indiscretions<br /><br />

one after another, who&#39;s to tell whether<br />
she fell in love too easily or not at all?<br /><br />

subliminal scars traverse wrists, shins<br />
chief inspector thinks stigmata, then chokes<br /><br />

back his unchewed dogmatism, spewing out<br />
baptismal-like onto the parking lot, rinsing away<br /><br />

all forensic evidence of foul play or wtf<br />
i was last seen trying to say, <i>choke me</i><br /><br />

only long enough to make the ceiling blur<br />
to make the mad forget their self-inflicted<br /><br />

sores, deep inside the drawstring pockets<br />
of the body left to rot outside your door</p><br /><br />

<p><b>fucked up firsts</b><br /><br />

as if it&#39;s just another tourist trap inside my dirty film debut<br />
there&#39;s no one actually inside me but a b&amp;w tequila worm<br />
they green-screen the erection in later, pin the tail on the <br />
imaginary friend, play <i>pretend we were each other’s fucked<br />

thinking sex on the beach wouldn&#39;t hammer sand straight<br />
through my hourglass physique- yes, i see this year <br />
it&#39;s chic to misremember, tremor, have too much to drink<br />
but in the long run who will recreate, cosplay the deadbeat <br />
dungeon master w/ his feet up on the back of daddy&#39;s seat?</p><br /><br />

I&#39;m verifying my own virginity w/ a magnifying glass until the sun starts to burn through<br />
I been thank-you-much baptized in ape shit &amp; jungle funk since the day I was first misconstrued<br />
I still feel it running out the raging parties of my undies: reefer dens &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mushroom hells &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lazy <br />

I&#39;m not changing my street name this late in the game &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not taking any rides downtown<br />
just to powder my ashes over the village oil can &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or snub the upchuck cuties on the corner<br />

and try to cast fireballs at them<br /><br />
but their health regenerates too quickly<br /><br />
because the leveling up system is broken<br /><br />
and bethesda realized this and fixed it in skyrim<br /><br />
but you aren&#39;t playing skyrim<br /><br />
and now the trolls have murdered you<br /><br />
that&#39;s what it feels like not talking to you</p>
<p><br /><br /><br /></p>
<p><b>cheat code</b><br /><br /><br />
not feeling very motivated<br /><br />
not feeling very challenged by life<br /><br />
because i live in my childhood bedroom<br /><br />
this is life on easy mode<br /><br />
you can&#39;t get the best ending on easy mode<br /><br />
i don&#39;t care about endings or beginnings or the middle<br /><br />
mature people take coffee breaks at starbucks near their places of work while talking to other working people about work<br /><br />
they write short non emotional emails that refer to the contents of spreadsheets or other emails<br /><br />
they do this for forty to fifty years<br /><br />
i stare at a screen and wait for the internet to tell me what emotion to experience next<br /><br />
there is a gigantic hole in my mind that information technology plugs up<br /><br />
i try to imagine myself feeling worked up enough about life to scream silently in my head for three hours but i don&#39;t<br /><br />
i would flush this poem down the toilet but it’s on my macbook and that won&#39;t fit down the toilet even if i shatter it first<br /><br />
so instead i just stare at it and try to subtract any emotion­inducing lines or words out of it because aren&#39;t we past that stuff by now<br /><br />
imagine seagulls flying toward the sunset growing and expanding into Salvador Dali type creatures dripping liquid clocks over parked cars and pedestrians while humming chopin&#39;s nocturnes<br /><br />
would that be beautiful?<br /><br />
i don&#39;t know what is beautiful<br /><br />
this poem is an exegesis on continental philosophy and aesthetics<br /><br />
beautiful things disappear as you approach them<br /><br />
my computer is telling me not to get a job<br /><br />
i tell it ok<br /><br />
i feel better for a little while and then don&#39;t</p>

The Verizon® logo.<br />
It ruins the view so much that it’s kind of beautiful in its own way.<br /><br />

It’s real.<br /><br />

I guess time just doesn’t stop for us dear,<br /><br />

They made the summer faster to skip the previews,<br /><br />

We keep cutting corners though,<br /><br />

like wild frost flowers growing out of their habits.<br /><br />

You know what?<br /><br />

This would probably look better on my screensaver,<br /><br />

Bird baths, Cherry Blossoms,<br /><br />

Yellow taxi cabs.<br />
A lonely peanut<br />
inside a yellow flavored M&amp;M.<br /><br />

A chocolate smudge on our shirts.<br /><br />

You got my heart leaking 16 fl oz. at a time.</p>

          <div><p><b>Circulars</b></p>
<p>Upstairs, the one legged man taps on the floor<br />
and I think it is someone knocking at our door.<br />
Sometimes when I am lying in bed<br />
I can hear him in the toilet.<br />
Our flats are laid out backward.<br />
His lounge is above my bedroom,<br />
his bedroom below our lounge.<br />
The kitchens are in completely different places.<br />
Once, Jackson said he could hear the <br />
one legged man peeing while he was peeing.<br /><br />

The one legged man leaves his newspapers on the footpath<br />
and his junk mail in the mailbox.<br />
We bring his junk mail down to him<br />
and put it on his barbecue,<br />
but it just ends up blowing around<br />
on our steps and getting caught out in the rain.<br /><br />

The one legged man stays home a lot.<br />
He watches a lot of movies and<br />
gets his food delivered from Countdown.<br />
The one legged man keeps his door open <br />
but I’ve only seen him once.<br />
The day we moved in,<br />
I knocked on his door frame.<br />
He came out and introduced himself.<br />
He said he likes to play music<br />
and we should tell him off if it gets too loud.<br />
The one legged man’s music is never too loud<br />
but it’s not enjoyable either.<br /><br />

The one legged man has two cats.<br />
They are both incredibly shy.<br />
One of them accepts pats<br />
but the other one will hide under the house <br />
if he sees you coming.<br />
One time, I sat down on the couch<br />
and the shy cat shot out from behind it<br />
and ran out the door.<br />
The one legged man seems nice enough.<br />
We borrowed his can opener once.</p>
<p>&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;</p>
<p><b>House</b></p>
<p>I tie a thread around my ankles
and lower my body down
beneath the deck
to watch the cats with human faces
clean themselves in the half-light
of their homes.

A zeppelin disguised as a kereru
propels itself magnificently
through the stratosphere overhead
and my person-eyes are transfixed
by the person-eyes in front of mine,
set in their frame of orange fur.

How far back does the person go,
I wonder –
as in, are they person-brains or cat-brains
living inside?

Their homes are so clean,
pitched roofs and whitewashed boards
fitted snug to the land,
the gentle roll of the hill.
It is hard to hold onto them,
hard to keep sight of their scale
as we tap dance on the lino 
above their heads.</p>
<p>&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;</p>
<p><b>Houseplants</b></p>
<p>Trees march down the window 
panes 
of all the apartment buildings
in straight diagonal lines.

A woman peers through the plants
in her window
and smiles as you pass.

Smile back.

A foot appears in the gutter,
lonely,
pierced by a metal rod.

Pick it up and 
place it in your bag.</p>

          <a href="/february2016/2016/02/14/10.html"><h3 class="contrast">Birds</h3></a>
          <br><span class="smaller">by Jackson Nieuwland on February 14, 2016</span>  <br/>
          <div><p>Bianca had to move to the new school because an earthquake broke her old school. The ground swallowed all the buildings. The new school was full of sparrows. When they came into the classrooms it was not the usual chaos of hollow bones slamming into double glazed glass and feathers floating slowly to the floor to be picked up, one at a time, by small fingers, during the end of day tidy up. The birds knew their way around. They never entered accidentally through open windows, always came in politely through the front door and, when they were ready, exited the same way.</p>

<p>Occasionally a child would arrive at school in the morning to find a nest had been built in their desk overnight, their books torn to shreds and woven into an origami home for eggs which was not to be disturbed until the caretaker had a spare minute to relocate it to a nearby treetop. When teachers ran out of activities for their students, they had them make bird feeders to join the multitudes that hung all around the school like fire alarms, but the sparrows were more interested in the children’s lunches, so occasionally you would see a five year old who had thrown all his chips to the birds sucking on a peanut butter smeared pinecone.</p>

<p>Bianca hadn’t been told any of this. On her first day at the school, the principal pointed her to a classroom and the teacher pointed her to a desk. She sat, without first looking down at the chair, and felt a crunch flow into wetness on the back of her new tan skirt with the owl print. She had worn it to look nice because she didn’t have a school uniform yet. Quickly standing, she looked down at the chair and saw a flattened bird’s nest with a dead something inside. Her eyes went wide and she rushed out of the class.</p>

<p>On her way to the sickbay to get a change of clothes Bianca walked past the staffroom, where every morning, before the nine o’clock bell rang, the teachers huddled around the coffee table, kneeling on the carpet, and did lines of cocaine. They needed the hit in order to deal with the children’s endless Whys. Then they needed another hit at morning tea, one at the beginning of lunch and another at the end of it. The cleaners, who came every night, were not given keys to the staffroom. They were told the teachers cleaned it themselves to set a good example for the children. The cleaners didn’t think this was working very well judging from the mess in the classrooms that they were paid to remove.</p>

<p>When Bianca got back to class in a borrowed, too tight, pair of jean shorts everyone was sitting in a circle on the floor sharing their news. They stood one at a time and, while the rest stared up at them, started with Did You Know.<br />
“Did you know I went to the supermarket.”<br />
“Did you know Amelia came to my house.”<br />
“Did you know I have this.”<br />
A toy truck, a new lunchbox, an empty Pepsi Max bottle. Bianca hung back in the doorway searching for her spot in the circle, but there was no extra space. A boy stood up.<br />
“Did you know that girl killed a bird,” he said, pointing straight at Bianca.<br />
Everyone looked at her with expressions on their faces. She ran back out of the classroom and sat under a tree until the teacher came out fifteen minutes later and brought her back in, while the other kids were doing their handwriting.</p>

<p>The next day Bianca returned wearing a new school uniform, the borrowed jeans freshly washed and folded in a plastic bag in her hand. She returned them to the front desk at the office.<br />
“Well aren’t you looking smart today,” said the receptionist.<br />
Bianca didn’t respond with words but gave a small smile and looked down quickly.<br />
“Better run to class dear,” the receptionist said, kindly giving Bianca a way out of the situation.<br />
She nodded and rushed out of the office. She sprinted across the playground and into her classroom even though there were still five minutes til the bell rang and all the other children were playing outside. She sat in the room alone, staring at her cellphone. The battery had died on her way to school and the black screen looked like a bottomless pool of water. When the other students eventually trickled into the classroom they didn’t greet her, but they didn’t mention the incident from the day before either.</p>

<p>The first part of class, as always, was news. The teacher sat on a chair while the students formed a circle on the floor, each with a toy or accessory or new item of clothing clasped tight in their hands. The teacher coughed. The children began sharing their news, their Did You Knows. It came around to Bianca.<br />
“Do you have anything to tell us about, Bianca,” said the teacher.<br />
Bianca shook her head and looked up at the white ceiling. There were thousands of tiny, perfectly circular, holes. They moved on to the next boy in the circle.<br />
“Did you know my daddy has new running shoes.”</p>

<p>The next day, at the beginning of lunch, Bianca slipped on a patch of bird droppings, grazing her knee. She sat, crying on the concrete, with her legs pulled up to her chest. The principal happened to be walking past. He knelt down.<br />
“Is it your first day of school,” he said.<br />
“Yes. No. It’s my third day,” said Bianca.<br />
“That’s nice. You’ll be okay.”<br />
The principal rubbed her back and then wandered off. Five minutes later he was in the staffroom, doing two lines of coke back to back. Two friendly children came up to Bianca and helped her to the sick bay where the office receptionist cooed over her.<br />
“You are having a tough week, aren’t you.”</p>

<p>On Thursday Bianca skipped her turn at news again. At lunchtime she hung out with the boy and girl who had helped her the day before. They played a game where they told Bianca to run around a block of buildings. Each time, when she got back, they told her she had either gone too fast or too slow and she had to do it again. It was her best day at the school yet.</p>

<p>The next morning when it came to her turn at news, and the teacher asked if she had anything to share, Bianca said yes. The teacher blew her nose.<br />
“Bless you,” said Bianca.<br />
She stood up and smoothed out her skirt with her palms, wiping the sweat off them at the same time.<br />
“Off you go,” said the teacher as she scratched the edge of her nostril.<br />
A bird hopped in through the doorway.</p>

<p>“Did you know last night I had a bad dream,” said Bianca.<br />
The teacher’s nose began running. She dabbed at it with a tissue, focusing on Bianca’s story.<br />
“I can’t remember all of it, just some bits.”<br />
The bird hopped further into the room.<br />
“My daddy was there.”<br />
The teacher scrunched up her nose and blew it again.<br />
“He was chasing me.”<br />
She looked down at the tissue and saw a bloody snot glob oozing in the centre of it. She quickly tucked it behind her back. The bird extended its wings and wobbled into the air.  It veered left into a window, banging the glass, and losing two feathers which floated slow down to the floor. A few children glanced over at it but quickly switched their attention back to Bianca’s story.<br />
“He had a egg beater but big.”</p>

<p>A drip of blood leaked from one child’s nose, but he didn’t notice it. While listening to Bianca, he licked his upper lip without registering the salty taste on his tongue.<br />
“He said he wanted to tell me something.”<br />
The blind bird bashed repeatedly into the window, losing more feathers, but no one heard the noise over Bianca’s quiet voice. Blood was running freely from the teacher’s nose now.<br />
“We were in the hallway and I started running.”</p>

<p>More of the children’s noses started bleeding. The teacher’s head dropped to her chest, the front of her blouse staining red, tissues slipping from her hand. The bird swooped across the room, slamming into the opposite window and falling to the floor.<br />
“The hall just kept getting longer and longer and the walls were covered in pictures I had drawn.”<br />
One of the boys stuck two fingers up his nostrils, then pulled them out and began fingerpainting deformed red circles on his arm. The teacher slumped forward, her face in a pool of blood in her lap.</p>

<p>“There was a mirror at the end of the hall but I couldn’t see myself in it, just my Dad winding the egg beater faster and faster.”<br />
Children were collapsing all around her but Bianca wasn’t paying any attention, she was too busy making up her story.<br />
“I heard my Mum’s voice from the other room yelling to hurry up.”</p>

<p>The bird staggered through the air in short leaps to land in the centre of the circle while the last few children collapsed. It hopped around, tapping it’s beak on fallen children’s shoes. Then it returned to the centre of the circle, wearing half as many feathers as it had when it entered, and flew straight out the front door. Two more birds flew into the room. Then they flew back out. Then another four flew in. They circled the room a few times before coming down to land, hopping over the bodies.</p>
<p>“That’s all I can remember.”<br />
Bianca noticed a small bloodstain on the sleeve of her shirt from the boy sitting to her left. Thinking she might be bleeding herself, she quietly exited the room and walked to the sick bay, crunching fallen leaves under her new sneakers. When she stepped into the office building the receptionist looked up at her.<br />
“More trouble sweetheart.”<br />
Bianca held up her sleeve in explanation.</p>

there's a woman so tall<br />
her head pokes out above the sky<br />
all she sees up there is fire <br /><br />

her spine holds a river though<br />
i sail in it<br />
the tides tattoo her shoulders<br /><br />

she doesn't lie down to sleep<br />
so we don't get crushed<br />
just closes her eyes<br /><br />

Trains carry me places<br />

I sit naked on<br />

My genitals are a tiny <br />

<p>1. Fluidity of friction is a (con)sensual (con)tradiction. For ‘we’ need to be one and other in order to organize across oceans. The one sees all the same sea, but must free messages to distant spirits floating beyond bridge of me-we-being. To do so requires fine signal reception. Therefore everything visible operates as symbol, like flesh and fabric of skin, foretelling futures for kin lines to come. [Theory of Scattered Islands]</p>

          <a href="/reviews/2016/01/15/salt.html"><h3 class="contrast">Salt is for Curing: A Review</h3></a>
          <br><span class="smaller">by Christopher Morgan on January 15, 2016</span>  <br/>
          <div><p><img alt="salt is for curing" class="inline_image" src="http://alienmouth.com/reviews/salt.png" style="width:350px;height:350px" /></p>
<p>Freshly served by Sator Press, Sonya Vatomsky&rsquo;s first full-length collection, &ldquo;Salt is For Curing&rdquo; uses its dark feasts and folklore to explore the frailty of our memories and bodies. With photography by Sator&rsquo;s founding editor, the cover&rsquo;s salt circle invokes and repels darkness, sealing the poems within. Guiding readers through its three courses, Vatomsky&rsquo;s poetry is a truly generous offering, complete with aperitif and digestif.</p>

<p>As the title reminds how we can hold onto things for an almost unnatural length of time, much of this collection commemorates what&rsquo;s passed. The opening poem, &ldquo;Bathymetry,&rdquo; stretches from old legends of empowerment and oppression all the way to the present, as we&rsquo;re told: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the kind of light / you name galaxies after. / Andromeda, for example, / which means &ldquo;ruler of men&rdquo; / so, of course / they stripped her naked and chained her / to a rock&rdquo; (11). Like a dinner toast for a death, this collection&rsquo;s recurring spells and other forms crystallize facts for future audiences:</p>
<p><br />
<br />
 </p>
<div class="inline_poem" style="text-align: justify"><b>&ldquo;Apotheosis&rdquo;</b><br />
<br />
The recipe called for murder; I did not misread it:&nbsp;6 SPRIGS FRESH DILL, as much&nbsp;SALT&nbsp;as you can stand,&nbsp;and take a&nbsp;KNIFE&nbsp;to the one that failed you.&nbsp;1 WHOLE POTATO, 1 WHOLE CARROT. You will not be cold this winter, you will not.&nbsp;Locate the&nbsp;JOINT, move the&nbsp;BONE&nbsp;back and forth; it can be&nbsp;hard to find the&nbsp;ARTICULATION POINT&nbsp;with the sobs still lodged&nbsp;in your throat like fish bones. Chop the&nbsp;DILL&nbsp;into fine green shards;&nbsp;they are the forest you bury him in. They are the fog&nbsp;on the fallen leaves on the wet snow on the soil. They are the wood frog and the arctic lamprey and the brown bear&nbsp;leaving trails in the opposite direction. Use your&nbsp;KNIFE&nbsp;to&nbsp;TRIM excess&nbsp;FAT,&nbsp;REMOVE&nbsp;the&nbsp;BONE&nbsp;with minimal damage&nbsp;to the meat, turn his memory to the grounds that sit&nbsp;at the bottom of your porcelain cup painted in wild strawberries: a fortune teller&rsquo;s ephemera. Use the tip of your&nbsp;KNIFE &mdash; not the blade,&nbsp;lest he leave rings on you like an aging tree &mdash; in short&nbsp;flicking motions.&nbsp;REMOVE&nbsp;the&nbsp;BONE&nbsp;with minimal damage&nbsp;to the meat. As much&nbsp;SALT&nbsp;as you can stand, rubbed the way you&rsquo;d rub&nbsp;an ache until it gives in beneath you. Little peat bog, little бог,&nbsp;little God. Ivan the Fool slept on an oven and so will you. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (34)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;</div>

<p>Whether by broiling, carving, or extracting, these poems address grief on their own terms. Blending personal experience with instruction, Vatomsky teaches us that tears are a surprisingly fine substitute for most ingredients, and that, &ldquo;To brew a love potion is to kill yourself but to poison is to breathe&rdquo; (71). But these poems also serve as timelines, occupying the past to resist forgetting. With its many references to food and language, &ldquo;Salt is For Curing&rdquo; blurs the line between identity and context, and how we place ourselves within our own history.</p>

<p>Yet these poems recognize that no amount of salt can preserve something forever. Food must be eaten, or it perishes. Bodies must be buried, or hidden. Leading us into the swamplands by a &ldquo;chain of rope and scarves,&rdquo; the speaker laments: &ldquo;I am being carefully and / systemically forgotten&rdquo; (22), as if even memories decay in the mire. But these poems know the dirty details required for moving on, whether from a stern mother&rsquo;s advice, or somebody who&rsquo;s learned the &ldquo;safest place to bury a body / is in another body / is in your own body&rdquo; (17). Vatomsky knows we learn through pain&mdash;licking our wounds until the taste of blood no longer scares us&mdash;as a witch &ldquo;can only be burned so many times before she thinks hmm / something has got to change here&rdquo; (73).</p>

<p>&ldquo;Salt is For Curing&rdquo; offers the ultimate reward in exchange for your darkest red. Making a thick paste from a phoenix&rsquo;s bones to reexamine resurrection myths, these poems count all 32 teeth, then eat your words with bread. Sonya Vatomsky reflects upon salt and suffering, creating a literary love potion that&rsquo;s equal parts wishing well and butcher&rsquo;s hook.</p>

<p>Founded in 2014 by Nicci Mechler, Porkbelly Press is a queer-friendly, feminist press focused on producing limited and small edition, handbound chapbooks. Having already released a few pocket-sized anthologies (inspired by such themes as Emily Dickinson&rsquo;s life + the art of letters), the press has recently released its fourth compilation, &ldquo;Myth+Magic,&rdquo; which features poetry and prose exploring &ldquo;folk tale, fable, fairy tale, gods, monsters, myth, magic, tricksters, divination, witchcraft, and herbalism.&rdquo; Adorned with gorgeous cover art, &ldquo;under water,&rdquo; by Angie Reed Garner, this collection charms our senses and expectations, providing a glimpse into a buried, fantastical warning.</p>

<p>Each of the seven poets in this collection refuse simple retellings, such as in Andrea Blythe&rsquo;s opening poem, &ldquo;Red Riding Hood Remembers,&rdquo; which reexamines the supposed facts of the classic tale&mdash;&ldquo;how she had / not once, not once, ever asked to be saved&rdquo; (9). Likewise, M. Brett Gaffney&rsquo;s fable quickly immerses readers in the life of a young hunter as she learns something unexpected of the real world:</p>

<div class="inline_poem"><b>&ldquo;Hunters&rdquo;</b><br />
<br />
After supper she pulls on boots,<br />
prepares her heart.<br />
The girl is small but carries the gun<br />
like she would a baby, twig fingers light<br />
on its tongue of a trigger.<br />
<br />
Her father hoists his rifle, heavy with ammo,<br />
the glint of his knife like teeth in the fading light.<br />
<br />
They hunt at twilight, when wild things stumble<br />
onto the roads like drowsy children,<br />
thickets busy with thorns.<br />
<br />
Up in the old oak they wait<br />
for beasts that have no godly name.<br />
<br />
She still remembers the sound<br />
of the wolf&rsquo;s howl<br />
as her father&rsquo;s bullet<br />
found home in hot flesh.<br />
<br />
How the animal&rsquo;s hide<br />
all fur and full of stars,<br />
rippled like an angry ocean<br />
until it sloughed off to something<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;smoother and human.<br />
<br />
That night she saw a man&rsquo;s body for the first time<br />
&mdash;the cut of thigh like cloudy bread,<br />
soft gathering of hair below his belly.<br />
<br />
The way his eyes told her a story about herself,<br />
one she tucked inside her jacket<br />
along with his sharpest fang. (10-11).<br />
&nbsp;</div>

<p>Further instilling freshness into familiar tales, Laura Bylenok&rsquo;s two poems, &ldquo;Rape of Electra&rdquo; and &ldquo;Caiman,&rdquo; drive the reader through dark scenes of sacrifice, rebirth, and divided waters. Throughout these pieces we find the natural world, always sharp and present, as Suzanna Anderson shares a haiku about a wound-licking lilac, or Monica Rico ponders heartbeats and humidity, &ldquo;the predictable / human body / easily missed&rdquo; (17), suffocating flowers, and baby snapping turtles. But these poets are also our guides, as Lisa Megraw&rsquo;s first poem reveals a witchy path to &ldquo;a mythical / place hidden between worlds&rdquo; (25) in &ldquo;How to Take the Raven as Your Birth Sign,&rdquo; with advice such as: &ldquo;Peel the shadows off migrating birds / then under covers of darkness / slip inside their bruised / emptiness&rdquo; (24). In further poems of instruction, Sarah Ann Winn&rsquo;s whimsical &ldquo;How to Fold a Dream&rdquo; has the reader stack mockingbirds inside of themselves, packing away Venus and constellations to craft a stowaway dream you can examine from your pocket.</p>

<p>Succinct and controlled, the three prose pieces in &ldquo;Myth+Magic&rdquo; paint encounters between humans and the supernatural. &ldquo;Hamadryad&rdquo; by Lucas Olson details grim irony as a spirit of the woods finds her sister&rsquo;s former tree-self returned as a weapon, wielded by a weeping man. Indeed, &ldquo;there is never any life in an axe&rdquo; (12), as tragedy can only end one way. And halfway through the anthology, Marlana Patton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Juliet&rdquo; is a surprisingly moving tale where an enormous spider&rsquo;s infatuation with a farmer offers the only possibility of her surviving the freezing winter: &ldquo;Only a few days ago he caught a small jumping spider very near the shed. She saw delight in his face as he watched it spring from one hand to the other. He could understand this&rdquo; (22-23). Closing the anthology is &ldquo;The Lemon Seed&rdquo; by Leah Browning, where a girl swallows a lemon seed daily, hoping for it to grow&mdash;only to find her wish suddenly, rapidly fulfilled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Myth+Magic&rdquo; shows us how beauty and danger can often occupy and captivate within the same space&mdash;which makes what comes next all the more unreal. Rejecting the ordinary with every line, the writers in this anthology not only engage their readers with imaginative details, but also use these same concise worlds to introduce the everyday hardships of love, surprise, and sorrow.</p>

          <br><span class="smaller">by Christopher Morgan on November 15, 2015</span>  <br/>
          <div><p><img alt="animal problems" class="inline_image" src="http://alienmouth.com/reviews/katies.png" style="width:350px;height:350px" /></p>
<p>A flagship title from Electric Cereal&rsquo;s recent press expansion, Katie Foster&rsquo;s debut collection, &ldquo;Animal Problems,&rdquo; reconciles the rift between our human and animal selves, sharing the emotional hurdles in the process. Even the cover art, aptly crafted by Adriana Lafarga, embodies this unique blend of intimacy, instinct, and vulnerability. Equally at home in either allegory or reflection, these poems inhabit speculation and deeper emotions in the same landscape, as we&rsquo;re told: &ldquo;Here is / everything else I do not know for / sure: how a needle enters skin / (pushes it open, really, holds a human / space), &amp; what is the capital of Nebraska / &amp; where I will be when I stop / loving you&rdquo; (31).</p>

<p>Whether looking at dueling ownerships in the title poem or the sliminess of heartbreak, &ldquo;Animal Problems&rdquo; showcases its clever mix of creatures for a wide range of moods. Sometimes the beasts claim you, before burying you beneath the soil. Other times you want the soggy dog to rescue you, but he can&rsquo;t. Foster knows how our wants emerge and clash in seemingly convoluted ways, as in the succinct series named &ldquo;Two Things I No Longer Have Come Together,&rdquo; where the speaker&rsquo;s ex-lover and &ldquo;all / American boy dog&rdquo; (13) simultaneously wander the same poetic ecosystem. Two sides of the speaker&rsquo;s heart collide, just as her dog suddenly finds itself eye-to-eye with a towering black bull.</p>

<p>And this is how much of Foster&rsquo;s collection succeeds, contrasting the animal qualities inside us against our societal fears. Along these lines, Foster&rsquo;s poem, &ldquo;Inventory,&rdquo; is a testament to such dichotomies:</p>
<p> </p>

<div class="inline_poem"><b>Inventory</b><br />
<br />
Mom is living. Mom&rsquo;s mom is dead.<br />
My houseplants are living. Myspace is dead.<br />
Punk is dead. The rich are living.<br />
Arnold Schwartzenegger is living. Robots are dead.<br />
The ends of my hair are dead. Yogurt is living.<br />
The squirrel on route 9 is definitely dead. Debts are living.<br />
What I forgot is dead. A walk is living.<br />
Door home is dead. Getting a new wife is living.<br />
The other car is dead. Strangers on the internet are living.<br />
Having a lot of sex is living. Baby teeth are dead.<br />
Period blood is dead. Too much spit is living.<br />
Dry grass is dead. April is half living.<br />
The cicadas are dead. You are living.<br />
I am not dead. I am not dead.<br />
You are not here. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (18)</div>
<p> </p>

<p>Though even as the speaker organizes and accumulates details, only so much can be controlled in our lives. In the poem, &ldquo;Image,&rdquo; Foster further contrasts images against their antithesis&mdash;&ldquo;a child wearing all blue&rdquo; is not &ldquo;a soft brick,&rdquo; just as a &ldquo;lone seagull circling a Walmart&rdquo; is not &ldquo;your feelings&rdquo; (19). Whether we&rsquo;re shown a shapeshifting dog arising from chemicals, an orgy that never happens, or drunken playground antics with Viking symbols, we continually find the speaker reaching for long-gone connections as love enters and leaves our lives. But Foster is no fool, knowing one must learn to accept loss; after all, &ldquo;The death is what lasts&rdquo; (57). Otherwise you might find yourself falling into traps, watched by people who withhold the answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Animal Problems&rdquo; knows whether to need a knife or a key. It leads us into the woods to make a mess of our hair, exploring the dark places closed off in the aftermath. Like the villanelle&rsquo;s refrain, &ldquo;I drive the space between us&rdquo; (32), Katie Foster finds a way to both embody and combat distance. Whether following the girl slug undone by love, or reflecting upon &ldquo;How unusual it is // to disappear&rdquo; (35), these poems pit our animal hearts against everything our culture does to disturb us, suggesting that maybe all our problems aren&rsquo;t nearly as complicated as we might think.</p>

          <div><p>Body wants to give, but give <br />
for want. Lays the arms out <br /><br />
like oars. Nothing else <br />
smells like the ocean save for your hair <br /><br />
after salt has tied into. Fingers <br />
of the Navy Yard Basin make a pass <br /><br />
at the BQE. By East Mill, Body <br />
pulls a tooth from its mother, <br /><br />
her mouth the rigid shore. Says <br />
when none of us were happy <br /><br />
we went to the creeks, separate <br />
like corners. We are arrows <br /><br />
in the same animal. Infidelity<br />
has always tempted us.<br /><br />
We’ll both sleep alone tonight. I wore <br />
this lipstick for myself.<br /><br />
Somewhere, we are spectators at a wedding <br />
The dance floor is an armory<br /><br />
If I am a blood-red lip<br />
you are a mouth of bad cornmeal.</p>

          <br><span class="smaller">by Jeremy Freedman on November 1, 2015</span>  <br/>
          <div><p><b>Nothing and Something</b></p>

<p>It's been a week <br />
since I ran out of milk;<br />
that's the sum total<br />
of all that's happened<br />
since I came home from Italy,<br />
where I saw the tenderest <br />
Bellini mother and child <br />
in the Brera,<br />
and saw there <br />
in the faces of the men<br />
at the Disputation’s edge<br />
how solitude<br />
can be performed<br />
in plain view<br />
in the shadows <br />
of the sunset.<br />
It's easy to write about nothing:<br />
nothing is what we know <br />
when the day is foggy <br />
and the apartment <br />
has no heat<br />
and no trip to Italy,<br />
no matter how recent,<br />
can compensate. <br />
Not so easy to write<br />
about something:<br />
the mortadella <br />
I smuggled home, <br />
hidden in my carry-on,<br />
just so <br />
I had some skin<br />
in the game <br />
and another creature’s<br />
viscera<br />
to pick at.<br />
</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p><b>Duck Duck Goose</b></p>

<p>I have several of Donald Duck's <br />
most inauspicious traits:<br />
I'm pretty but I'm boring,<br />
I'm moodier than the usual,<br />
my urine is a dull yellow,<br />
my beak hangs unhinged<br />
when I doff my hat,<br />
I only wear my underwear<br />
on my birthday.<br />
I'm jejune, <br />
I'm willing to shill,<br />
I butter my scones<br />
with Sisyphus's groans,<br />
my pupils don't dilate<br />
when I shut the lights.<br /><br />

When I shut the lights<br />
the years weigh heavy;<br />
I carry them high,<br />
thrust out in front.<br />
I demand your seat<br />
on the subway.<br />
I'm up to my feet<br />
in chicken soup.<br />
My left breast is bigger<br />
than my right—that's right <br />
where my heart sits.<br /><br />

That's right where my heart sits,<br />
hovering below the choir,<br />
as big as the Higgs boson, <br />
right above my distended stomach.<br />
My lips taste like duck sauce:<br />
surely this is my ducktail<br />
I feel with my duckhand.<br />

          <br><span class="smaller">by Everett Warner on November 1, 2015</span>  <br/>
          <div><p>Has already lived one life. This, his second. He doesn’t like women. He doesn’t like vanilla. He doesn’t like me. He just likes watching me sleep. Unless I dream about women. Or vanilla. He hates when I do that. The young boy thinks watching the world sleep is less of a waste than being caged in my mind. The me that is asleep does not feel the same. The sleeping me keeps an eye on the me that watches me. In the morning, we will look at each other and neither of us will have eyes. One of us will get the eyes. The me that watches me will crawl back in through the invisible umbilical cord. And I will go back to sleeping.</p>

not sorry <br />

we’re experiencing technical difficulties<br />

<p>Dramatis Personae<br />
Riley, Playwright from the DIY music scene<br />
Akira, Riley's masked friend<br />
John Meowkovich, Riley's cat<br /><br />

SCENE—Riley's living room with the stereo system<br />
Enter Riley. They are hanging out in the living room, thumbing through records. They find the Cloth record. They sit and scan the cover. They put the record on. And the music plays for a bit. Then there's a knock on the door. And Riley gets up, answers the door.<br /><br />
Enter Akira.<br /><br />
<b>Riley:</b> What have you been up to?<br /><br />
(Akira shrugs.)<br /><br />
<b>Riley:</b> I have been chilling out working on this short play for Hannah's gutter show thing.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I showed the current edit to Hannah.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said that she liked the cat.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the last minute could be cut.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't think that says much about the play.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted her to say something about reality melting dripping oozing through the walls<br /><br />
(They listen to the record for a moment)<br /><br />
<b>Riley:</b> I fucking bought this record when I was in college, like I use to buy albums that were on labels that I liked, because there wasn't the internet yet.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like because I really didn't have a way to learn about music otherwise.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what I would do is, if I found a band.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bands were on record labels. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Labels would have catalogues.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catalogues would have all the other CDs.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CD stores still existed back then. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I would go to the record shop. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shop around until I would find bands from the catalogue. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there was mail orders too.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I got to college, well… I started out listening to rock. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Union were good, are good. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Union lead me to labels like Pop Bus direct line. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Union-like bands made up the entire Pop Bus catalogue.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Union and union-like filled my CD rack. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Union then became boring. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I listened to Prince for a while. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then when I got back into rock, it was bands like Color Front, because there was directly, had a direct line from Union to Color Font. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then eventually all bands started to sound like Union. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It wasn't that I branched off into like all corners of indy rock, some experimental music.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All corners of indy rock, some experimental music was devoured by my idea of what Union sounded like. <br /><br />
(They listen to the record for a moment)<br /><br />
<b>Riley:</b> I don't want to go to work tomorrow.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I go out in public, there's, there's just a lot of death.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spiritual death. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emotional death. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's just a lot of death. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not even a matter of believing in other people. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to walk into every situation almost like as comedian does.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at everything as a joke.  <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to go into every situation with every person I interact with and expect the worst situation and try to figure out how to make it good you know?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the only way. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's the only rational response.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trust me, I've tried to live all different ways. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, there's different types of jokes. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jokes have different functions. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can turn it around. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's inspirational. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can treat that as an inspiration…<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, not a joke but like, umm, a challenge. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge becomes the joke. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been testing this theory a lot since I have been working at Habitat for Humanity. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not on the clients. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the people I work with, they are more challenging than the clients. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel more natural with the clients than I do with the people I work with. <br /><br />
(They zone out in the music.)<br /><br />
<b>Riley:</b> Maybe I should ask these guys to see if they want to do the soundtrack for my play. <br /><br />
(They zone out in the music.)<br /><br />
<b>Riley:</b> There's ex military guys up at Habitat for Humanity who are extremely patriotic, they have flags everywhere. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is terrifying, it's the heart of darkness in some respects.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see it because there are one or two guys up there who are extremely proud of their service, who their entire ego is based around this service. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like they are proud in a way that the pride becomes the center of this person.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like they can't see the world in any other way. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just like steer clear of this person. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say hey to them, and I don't engage them in any other conversation. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless its in the bathroom or something, and it's just like, hey. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cus I know, that the minute I start interacting with this person, they would size me up, and I have already sized them up. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we will know that we are mortal enemies. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But its possible that he like prince. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could bond over that. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things like that have happened.<br /> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In work situations. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like meeting people who are extremely different in ways, but it's just like fuck, I really like that person. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like at my last job, at that last flower shop I worked at. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was this guy that I worked with, that I fucking really liked. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was older than me. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was like probably close to sixty. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was just this this fucking weird, hilarious dude. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was super hyperactive. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was always bopping around, saying funny shit, had a real funny way of talking.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And like he was like this super ultra ultra conservative hardcore Christian. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultra. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was like the jeasus freak of all jesus freaks. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was extra super crazy conservative about political shit. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Believes in the police, really hardcore right guy. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But me and him very quickly became like the comedy team, super hardcore. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he would say shit to get my going. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we would just start. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh man. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love this guy. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was so funny. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was really different from me, but he was really on the ball. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was hilarious. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His name was Roy. <br /><br />
(They zone out in the music.)<br /><br />
<b>Riley:</b> I don't want to do anything<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have directed my whole life to not doing anything<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the not-reading, not-making-shit, not-hanging-out type not-do-anything. <br /><br />
(Riley checks his phone.)<br /><br />
<b>Riley:</b> Oh shit, Hanah just texted me: told Nathan that you were making a play, and he said that it made his day. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's nice.<br /><br />
(Akira nods.)<br /><br />
<b>Riley:</b> Want another drink?<br /><br />
(Akira shrugs)<br /><br />
<b>Riley:</b> Alright. <br />
Exit [Riley]<br /><br />
(Akira sits in the room alone humming. The bumming becomes the soundtrack for the moment. Everything holds on Akira humming.)<br /><br />
Enter [Riley holding John Meowkovich]<br /><br />
<b>Riley:</b> Look who I found.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's John Meowkovich.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When got John Meowkovich at the animal shelter, they told us his medical history. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They said when they when they found him, he had an injury to his scrotum. He had not been neutered.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They said that when they found him, his balls were ripped open, his balls were hanging out. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But like something happened to him. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He might have been bit by a dog or something. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when they found him his ball sack was ripped open. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shows concern for the cat.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when I brought him home I was like dude I am never going to let something like that happen to you again. You're safe now.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like I felt so sorry for him. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he is such a sweet cat. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I first saw him in the shelter, he came right up to me and sat in my lap and I was scratching his chin and he would just not move. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He could just sit on top of me for like ever. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love at first sight. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He totally, he was like my cat. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew when I first saw him. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was like, that's my new buddy.<br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(They zone out in the music.)<br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if I just never finished the play<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if I just sat here listening to records until the power went out, until reality is reality melting dripping oozing through the walls<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put on Prince or some shit.<br /><br />
(Akira gets up.)<br /><br />
<b>Riley:</b> Oh shit, you're headed out? <br />
<b>Riley:</b> Allright duderz. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, it was great to see you.<br /><br />
Exit [Akira]<br /><br />
(Riley sits in the chair, listens to the music for a long time, like as though they were never going to stop, as though the play was never going to end.)

          <br><span class="smaller">by James Leaf on October 15, 2015</span>  <br/>
          <div><p>there is within humans a certain propensity for our emotional beings to atrophy over time. whatever the different circumstances, we have all known people who have allowed their capacities for love and empathy to deteriorate through small acts of neglect, violence, or pride&mdash;the weariness that presses on the bones, attempting to warp them. Raul Alvarez&rsquo;s THERE WAS SO MUCH BEAUTIFUL LEFT is about that tendency, or, perhaps, about that weariness; about succumbing and remaking, overcoming; about starting small and growing painfully but without fear; about coping and then learning to do better than that. this book is an ill, holy bonfire in the desert scratching messages to something like god or the space between two strangers standing at the same bus stop having really bad days.<br />
<br />
here&rsquo;s a snapshot:<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>from &ldquo;RAPID CYCLING&rdquo;:</b><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;lingering sexuality<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which takes your mind and makes it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;two, divided and divisive&mdash;I know it like the sunshine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seeping through the window reflecting off my ring<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;finger touching my coffee<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cup silently begging to be let in please come in!&rdquo;<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>from one of the untitled poems about the devil in part 2:</b><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;For five blurry years<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we&rsquo;ve owned the same ranch dressing<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neither of us remember buying it<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we don&rsquo;t remember buying any of our condiments&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>from &ldquo;IT&rsquo;S IMPORTANT TO BE HAPPY ABOUT HOW SAD YOU ARE&rdquo;:</b><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I know I&rsquo;ve said I love you too many times in this poem but it&rsquo;s okay because it&rsquo;s a rhetorical device. Rhetorical devices are language tricks you can use to tell people you love them.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I&rsquo;m saying is I owe a lot to people.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I&rsquo;m saying is if there is anything worthwhile about growing up religious is that you will never stop believing in magic no matter what you tell yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>from &ldquo;NOTES ON JOY&rdquo;:</b><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Fuck that. Take pain and loss like late season snow into your mouth&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
everyone wants to sign your cast so badly. people have come up with thousands of ways to add love to pain even if it doesn&rsquo;t fix anything. you gotta remember the point of all this living, its that people want to be bandages and not fists except sometimes people get really used to being fists and its hard/impossible/sacred to remind them that they&rsquo;re not fists.<br />
<br />
sometimes things never had a chance to choose between bandage and fist and those things can become hospitals and healing is always on the heels of pain, which causes our hands to reach out and become entwined with the hands of those around us. perhaps that&rsquo;s the only human universal and its why we try so hard for everyone around us.<br />
<br />
i think i learned these things from Raul&rsquo;s book. or maybe i always knew them and this book just reminded me.</p>

          <br><span class="smaller">by Chloe N. Clark on October 1, 2015</span>  <br/>
          <div><p>It is easy to see the physical signs of someone gone:<br />
the hairs left on pillows, the fingerprint left on a glass<br />
left by the sink, the line etched into a wall where height<br />
was recorded until the recorded was never going to get<br />
any taller. It is not as easy</p>

<p>to see the smaller traces left behind: the indent in a pillow<br />
slowly regaining its shape, the glass left in the cupboard<br />
that won’t be drunk from again by the same lips, the lines<br />
on faces that won’t appear because they only come with age.<br />
 It is nearly impossible</p>

<p>to see the things taken away with the one who has gone: <br />
the color bled from hair with worry, the glass that is picked<br />
up and set down and picked up too many times because the hands<br />
just need to be doing something, the lines studied on the palms<br />
of hands because your fortune never told you that this is what<br />
would happen, that this is loss</p>

<p>and it is irrevocable. This evidence<br />
is the evidence that does not forget because you cannot forget.</p>

<p>theyve got jowls and everything. these are some punk rock strawberries<br />
there’s a civilization in every seed and each one is yelling at the one next<br />
door to turn down the bass &amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp and the sirens &amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp to end more quietly<br />
and all delicately. and like, thematically. or something<br />
like the end of the world will be &amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp and often is<br />
all saltwater on flesh<br /><br />

“Nearer My God To Thee” playing as the sun goes down<br /> 
it’s mouth clamping  down on our corpses<br />
decorating the cupcake of this planet &amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp cute<br /><br />

CNN will still be broadcasting, of course. they’re holding the Titanic’s final<br />
note in a glassbottle in their database until they receive confirmation that<br />
the world is indeed ending. &amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp an intern has confirmed this (we’re<br />
good for something) (sometimes) (would you like these<br />
stapled or paper clipped)<br /><br />

i bring my mouth down on the strawberry, getting seeds stuck between my teeth<br />
i bare my teeth at the sun &amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp pretending the red flesh is someone else’s<br /><br />

i am so totally punk rock. i don’t look the sun in the eye but<br />
i am still so totally punk rock. i so totally feast on the jowls<br />
of poetry and the prelude to chapstick and smoothies and<br />
metaphor rotting in the fridge.<br /><br />

i am the sun, coming for the world. i am muting all these baby armageddons.<br />
these berry flavored apocalypses. &amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp cute &amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp cute cute cute &amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp , &amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp the end<br />

<b>WORKING FRIDAY NIGHTS IN HARVARD SQUARE</b>

<p>the lady ordering a latte was reading bossy pants<br />
and i was like “hey is that book good?”<br /><br />

and she looked at me like i had seventeen fingers<br />
attached to my left cheek because<br />
&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp How Dare The Coffee Gnome Speak Like a Person About Person Things<br />
and i was like YIKES OKAY MAYBE I’M NOT A PERSON AFTER ALL<br /><br />

and then she took her drink and went to sit down and unzipped<br />
a flap in the skin of her upperarm and shoved the book inside<br />
and i was like YIKES OKAY maybe i’m not the one who’s not human<br /><br />

and then a different lady, the woman who paints her <br />
face purple blue blue blue glitter came in with her luggage <br />
and her big scarf and she sits in the corner<br />
and she is talking to someone who isn’t there and she’s doing this while<br />
painting her face all starry night but like if van gogh had done it at the discoteque<br />
but like if the disoteque was underwater.<br />
&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp and she’s talking about the jazz age and also about<br />
 the fire that burned down the horsestable but also she’s really not able<br />
to stomach dairy this week and she doesn’t know what to do about it<br />
because being lactose intolerant is becoming an expensive trend in this college town<br />
but also HEY YOU &amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp YOU  WITH THE MOTOROLA <br />
WAITING FOR YOUR COFFEE &amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp YEAH YOU I SEE YOU<br />   
&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp YOURE NOT TAKING ME ANYWHERE<br />
I DONT EVEN HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE AND IM SICK<br />
OF THIS 1984 SHIT &amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp I WISH YOU’D ALL JUST LEAVE ME ALONE<br /><br />

OR AT LEAST SPOT ME 22 FUCKING CENTS<br /><br />

and she turns to her ghost friend and sobs, she is sobbing and then<br />
she is medusa’s mouth again, snakes coming out of the cranium<br />
of every word she says, she says one day &amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp one day one day one<br />
day one day one day one day one day<br />
one day one day one day<br />
one day one day one day one day<br />
one day one day the the entire world will be<br />
blue and people will be nice and maybe. maybe<br />
she is the most Person person here<br />

<b>the summer i keep yelling</b>

<p>i’ve swallowed all the elephants in the room,<br />
they hide under sheets like i can’t see them<br />
but i know they’re there. there’s a tiny dancing man<br />
making coffee somewhere between my elbow<br />
and my chest emoji. he back and forths<br />
to collect the magic beans scattered where i creak<br /><br />

i’ve started yelling about capitalism in the kitchen<br />
i do this by yelling CAPITALISM!!!! in the kitchen<br />
sam tells me to stop yelling un-popped punk at her<br />
and marisa tells me to stop reading Pinsky.<br />
&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp Pinsky uses his indoor voice<br />
and i think about how it will still always be louder than my outdoor voice<br />
&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp so now i am busting down the doors in my mouth  <br />     
the same way i am always busting open follicles <br />
to get to the caffeine of myself<br />
where the tiny man dances<br /><br />

while tiny man works, his third eye puts an ear to my chest and hums along<br />
i don’t have to tell him how much i love him or that it weirds me out<br />
that i do or that i know his voice like skin that traps an ingrown hair<br />
&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp like something that’s part of me, something i could also rip out, something <br />
&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp with eyelashes the same length as mine<br /><br />

i don’t know where i live anymore but i’ve started falling<br />
asleep, bottlecap charging in my palms. i am soaking up<br />
cosmic energy to phone the ambivalent space booger.<br />
i need to ask the Moon a thing. i need to ask it what to do<br />
when people keep leaving? &amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp when they’re actually<br />
planets hatching from human suits. i need to ask how i too<br />
can become a planet. or a non planet &amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp or an old cassette,<br />
or something like a hatchet to the gravitational pull<br />
between scars when scars match up. &amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp still ringing<br /><br />

so i ask sam instead and she tells me that when the kid upstairs runs,<br />
dust falls from the ceiling. her ivy plant covered with the slap of baby feet.<br /><br />

i leave the bottlecap upside down by my bed to catch more<br />
it’s always empty in the morning &amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp so i feed it to the elephants<br />
and they tremble &amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp their nails are upside down shot glasses<br />
cracking under the weight of the espresso that the tiny man in my chest<br />
is stacking every time i feel a thing. &amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp every time i close doors<br />
instead of busting them open &amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp i am running out of rooms.<br /><br />

i wake up next to a notebook open like a wound<br />
one centimeter to the left of mine so i’ll never write it<br />
down just right even when i finally can and so     <br />
i’m yelling in the kitchen &amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp i’m busting open follicles,     <br />
i want the scars lined up   and they tell me to stop yelling    <br />
to use my indoor voice &amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp to stop using hammers instead of keys        <br />
they want me to leave the room<br /><br />

and there is caffeine everywhere &amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbspi am leaking magic beans<br />
and the tiny man is riding the elephants out of my chest<br />
he wants me to look them in the eye &amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp but their eyelashes<br />
are too thick. they look like mine

your lie became animated with eye pupils/green &amp; mushy/ my hair started to take flight/”glup! slurp!”/the drunk spaniel had chewed the helium leaking like a pissy thong/from me/from the bamboo lips/there was no stopping/&amp; ears that smelled like clam chowder on my breath/ we floated up, up &amp; you waved my fallen shoe at me in a cursed goodbye/the dog barked/ bended his paws through wax paper clouds, chasing the glitter holes that were blinding us &amp; everywhere/it was china town emergency/ the cops/fried slug broth in sugar bowls/in mouth/&amp; the cops kept torching the night sky/ throwing soup cans with rolled up requests for me &amp; spaniel to land on earth, but I had just begun to eat marshmallows with zero calories, ya know? ya feel? &amp; spaniel agreed, so I took the requests &amp; put the roll-ups between the holes/ the night sky lit up, so lilted, so like a dirty skirt in a splooge fire/ the last thing I saw was your face, turning color &amp; punching air with your mega bushy groin, so you can have a little taste of the magic bamboo shoots/ the starlight spewed ashes from my lungs.

you still ask me about that night/not together but ours/first date/first hand sex we winged every time you go down on me, what a royal piss it was. but now, like today in this maybe rented apartment/it’s a blank dear, oh dear, fo sho.

          <div><p>You are sitting in bed<br />
sweating out a chicken <br />
noodle soup. You watch <br />
from afar.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Teng and Cruz live in a paint speckled<br />
apartment. Teng is dotting the ceiling <br />
and the walls with her skinny pale fingers.<br /><br /></p>

<p>She is poking craters into<br />
the moon at night. She is<br />
sending men to their deaths<br />
with holes in their skulls by doing wet <br />
willies in their temples, execution style.<br /><br /></p>

<p>They have gentrified the yuppies.<br />
Cruz has brought the soul back<br />
to the streets. Teng has blown<br />
up all of the art museums.<br /><br /></p>

<p><i>Such tackiness. Silly ang moh.<br />
Damned gringos. White flight.<br />
New Harlem Renaissance.</i><br /><br /></p>

<p>But sometimes they are tender<br />
and they lead the yuppies into <br />
coffee shops and buy them muffins.<br /><br /></p>

<p>You watch them dancing and laughing, <br />
you have a pair of binoculars. You<br />
are their peeping tom.  <br /><br /></p>

<p>You are also Pork Bun’s baby sitter.<br />
Sometimes they call you whenever<br />
it’s time for them to sing at the<br />
Yum Cha club. <br /><br /></p>

<p>In the afternoon you hear them<br />
echoing, eres para mí, Nǐ hé wǒ,<br />
always, always, always.<br /><br /></p>

<p>You know who they are. You watched <br />
Teng and Cruz, hand in hand, in loving<br />
 embrace, almost forming their own cocoon,<br />
 crash into Mother Earth as a meteor <br />
on the Lunar Year.  They woke with <br />
their lips connected.<br /><br /></p>

<p><i>Sweetness exchanged, mi amor.<br />
No pendejas shall steal you.</i><br /><br /></p>

<p>It was a cold night, you figured <br />
you had too much eggnog, despite<br />
that it wasn’t Christmas anymore. <br />
But they were so beautiful. You <br />
couldn’t your get eyes off of them. <br /><br /></p>

<p>So much so that when<br />
 they were looking for a<br />
 caretaker for their daughter,<br />
Pork Bun, you were the first<br />
email in their inbox.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Your cover letter looked <br />
like this:<i>I can cook a meen<br />
meel, I can speak conversational<br />
Spanish, I was once a yoga instructor.</i><br /><br /></p>

<p>You couldn’t spell or split<br />
your lips to form coherent<br />
sentences. And yet, they<br />
hired you. <i>Silly Ang moh<br />
wants to be our friend.</i></p>

          <br><span class="smaller">by Luis Neer on September 30, 2015</span>  <br/>
          <div><p><b>Scattered Ashes</b></p>

<p>Most of my life is a game of racquetball<br />
(I can’t like any of myself).<br /><br /></p>

<p>This poem is a translation<br />
from the jar of tears I never cried <br />
after watching The Elephant Man <br />
and gasping, seeing that John Merrick’s left hand <br />
was the only part of his body that was not disfigured, <br />
and thinking that its calmness was spreading <br />
across his body <br />
to make him radiate beauty.<br /><br /></p>

<p>I thought there was a poem to be found there, <br />
but something didn’t quite fit.<br /><br /></p>

<p>I wanted to relate it to my own self <br />
but I could not locate my own unscathed left hand.<br /><br /></p>

<p>My actual left hand bears a small white scar <br />
from where I accidentally lacerated the tissue <br />
when I was eight years old at my younger sister’s <br />
birthday party; I was trying to make a mask <br />
out of a weird kind of camouflage party hat<br />
(the world writes its own poems).<br /><br /></p>

<p>I am more like a fish <br />
in a glass bowl <br />
that is rolling down the side of a mountain <br /><br /></p>

<p>and the bowl shows my reflection <br />
and the bowl never breaks.<br /><br /></p>

<p>You told me that all my attributes<br />
are more than just a fortress<br />
to surround something rotten<br /><br /></p>

<p>but you are speaking to a wall<br /><br /></p>

<p>and I am standing <br />
behind it.</p>

<p><b>Motion Sickness</b><br />
<i>after Conor Oberst</i></p>

<p>Life is not a room<br />
People don’t just enter<br />
through some door<br />
drop odd objects and disappear<br />
Everything including you<br />
is in constant motion<br />
The first time I died<br />
my failed red heart had to choose<br />
just one way to paint my body<br />
I could have been a ballerina<br />
spinning frantic, toppling over<br />
into stupor<br />
I could have been a trembling hand<br />
I became a peeling wall<br />
a black hole<br />
a beacon of loneliness<br />
became abstract fire<br />
to warn rooms of people<br />
avert, avert your eyes<br />
I radiate nothing, save for<br />
this pale beam of doubt<br />
please don’t watch my light<br />
that smacks the floor and shatters<br />
I am searching for a place to feel solid<br />
standing still before the thunderstorm<br />
this planet holding its breath<br />
getting dragged around the Sun<br /></p>

          <div><p>Differences, indifferences, conspiracies, transparencies, oh run softly sweet Thames but it erupts so violently churning mad into, what is the origin of a river? The fish that squirms in your hands and slips with a plop— er versinkt im Ozean— your sticky hand. You lost it! That was a good one too, would have made a great trophy! Atrophy. I can't go to the store like this. Your red right hand. You haven't eaten. Look into these empty soup cans and watch yourself, yes, there! in the bottom. You have the uncountenance of a tomato. Red right hand.</p>
<p>Hush! Just shut up for a minute! (Don't try to open, just listen. These boulders that were my eyes).</p>
<p>Other voices. From behind the door. Other rooms.</p>
<p>-It's just unacceptable. I mean at first it was understandable, but now it's just unacceptable.</p>
<p>-What else can we do for him? You'd think he'd at least make an effort. You know when Dave came over the other day he wouldn't even shake his hand?</p>
<p>-You mean shaking someone's hand would be making an effort?</p>
<p>-What?</p>
<p>-Shaking someone's hand. You consider that him 'making an effort.'</p>
<p>-Well no I guess not. I just mean he won't even</p>
<p>-Did you shake Dave's hand?</p>
<p>-I patted him on the back.</p>
<p>-But you didn't shake his hand?</p>
<p>-What are you defending the little prick now?</p>
<p>-No. God no. He's lazy and it's absolutely unacceptable. It's like all he wants to do is lay in bed all day.</p>
<p>Lay all day lay all day lay all day stay away stay away stay awake</p>
<p>-It just seems like part of him has given up.</p>
<p>-Part?</p>
<p>-I'm sorry at this point it's just unacceptable. He needs to try to get a job, something, you know. Something to get him out of this rut.
(Then he can go back to giving people handshakes). (He's being an immature little jerk. I'm saying maybe then he'll grow up). (Wow I didn't know handshakes were a sign of being a mature grown up). (Why are you giving me so much shit about the goddamn handshake)?  (It's not about the fucking handshake (Are you brain-dead)? it's about the fact that you're (being an idiot) blind to the real issue with him). (The issue is that he's being immature). (The issue is we (I) are (am) not going to support him).</p>
<p>-We've got to give him an ultimatum. It's getting ridiculous.</p>
<p>It's getting louder! The tick tick tick. Little legs scampering across the floor. Du! ungeheurer Ungeziefer. Please don't crawl into my bed. Will it? Will it crawl into my bed? It's hard to say. Please don't let it. Okay, okay, easy there, child. But you must do something— there be produced an old hag— plight me thy trouthe heere in myn hand, the nexte thyng that I requere thee, thou shalt it do, if it lye in thy myght. To learn what it is women want? Bah! What is the origin of that river? Remember it is still wet where it churns and your hand slick. Don’t try to impress me with your reading for the read man makes me wary as the unthinking and the thinking. His life is a crisis and every moment a reference. You. You’ve fooled me, child. That cut I made does not bleed but hisses as severed wires and smells of smoldering plastic. Tell me, can you love?
Love? Whom? There's a spot in my head like the tip of an iron who's stirred great fires— Sir Tyro! He who prods at red coals which hiss with its contact and from within swell with heat, and as he pulls the iron from their depths— they erupt in flame! Oh! The skin does it blister and bubble in heat. Gone is Sir Tyro and you're doused in the waters of your river. There's a stray dog along its banks.</p>
<p>-Have you ever followed him?</p>
<p>-No. I don't think I want to know how he lives.</p>
<p>He goes into the alley-way behind a bar down-town. A man grossly pushes from the kitchen door whose fluorescent light scatters frantically about him and the steam from the street. He sets smoke to the yellow stained cigarette and there meets a man in a black suit emerging from the shadows (outer shadows hugging at the periphery of the way and building facades). He can see his figure, but only that, he wears a hat, through the smoke and through the wet night air.</p>
<p>-Your move, Mr. Brown. How long will we play these games?</p>
<p>-As long as it takes.</p>
<p>-What are you looking for?</p>
<p>-Answers.</p>
<p>-It depends on which way you want to hear it. Which way you want it told. Perhaps you’d like to know that you’re a product of lust and you were about to make the same mistake. That what you desire and call control is an illusion you find in chaos. You pretend you play a role but are terrified when you think and realize how much you’ve done without thinking. You gild myriad fractals haphazardly purged from the inevitable− your un-doing and call it beauty.</p>
<p>-And what about you? You killed her.</p>
<p>-I killed her?</p>
<p>-Yes. You killed her.</p>
<p>-Who am I? Think about it, Mr. Brown.</p>
<p>the dog stirs in the darkness. What was that?</p>
<p>-The truth is you depend on me. And I’ll have you grieve times over before it is through.</p>
<p>He holds up a small lace garment on the end of a pencil, the light intertwines in all its perforations.</p>
<p>-This was hers. Was it not?</p>
<p>It drops to the ground, flitting as it falls, each silken curve catching the breeze in its sensuous ballet. It lands neither gracefully nor abruptly but in its soggy pile joins the streetal amalgamate of indulgent filth.</p>
<p>Differences, indifferences, you'll know the same mort noire. </p>
<p>His fur is mangy and matted and he sniffs over the wet asphalt for something.</p>
<p>-Probably he's hungry.</p>
<p>-Probably...</p>
<p>His nose brushes past the muddy puddle that holds once lingerie. </p>
<p>-What are those little spots on the ground?</p>
<p>-Bottle caps. Bottleless caps.</p>
<p>Bottleless caps. Auch Essen oder nur Trinken? Nur Trinken für mich. Jawohl, was wollen Sie? Was habt ihr vom Fass? Nur Pils heute. Also, bitte schön.</p>
<p>Du musst gehen mein Freund. Du weißt dass, ja? Du musst hier weg gehen.</p>
<p>Warum? Ich bin noch komfortabel.</p>
<p>Es ist schlecht. Es ist richtig nicht gut. Du weißt dass, ja?</p>
<p>Ja. Ich glaube ich verstehe.</p>
<p>Wenn du stehst, wirst du nicht mehr bleiben, wirst du nicht mehr sein. Wann deine Füße nicht mehr laufen kann, wirst du fallen. Und du bist müde.</p>
<p>Ja. So trank ich und ging.</p>
<p>Shut up! Wake up! Träum nicht mehr. The voices of sleep, in your head, other voices, there are others. Behind the door. Other room. Leaving already? Please don't go.</p>
<p>I deceive only because I just don't know how to say.</p>
<p>-Why has he been like this?</p>
<p>-I don't know but I don't think I can handle it much more. He's not himself.</p>
<p>Not yourself not yourself not myself.</p>
<p>-Do you think you could find him a job? Pull him out of that rut? It'd do him good, I'm sure of that.</p>
<p>What don't you understand? They all know how full of shit you are. You're being fucking ridiculous.</p>
<p>-Can I tell you something? I saw a dog the other day. A stray dog. He walked past me watching with mangy eyes those dreadful eyes watching as he past. I reached out to him. There was something in my hand. I wanted to give him something to eat. red right hand. He came up to me slowly never averting those dreadful eyes and it bothered me I couldn't hold eye-contact no matter how I tried— those boulders that were my eyes— but he just kept watching, just keeps watching. He took it from my hand and tucked his tail between his legs and I tried to follow him but I couldn't go as far as him I just couldn't go that far</p>
<p>-just tell him the truth?</p>
<p>(What was her name? Susan? Would you Wake for Susan? Would you weep for Susan? For all the Susans?)</p>
<p>-The truth?</p>
<p>are you happy?</p>
<p>-That just because she's (hushed) dead doesn't mean he should be?</p>
<p>All the Susans. I wish I could have handled her death as well as she did mine.</p>
<p>Ich sagte: Kam nicht zürück. Mein Freund. Bitte.</p>
<p>It's cold in my hand. ?. Shouldn't it be? Red right hand. </p>
<p>Mein Freund, bitte. </p>
<p>HHHHHHWWWHHHOO.</p>
<p>But it won't be for long.</p>
<p>I don't think I want to follow him any farther I just can't go that far though maybe she could have and maybe if she were here I'd go with her, maybe if he didn't hurt so badly I'd follow him. How much longer will we play this little game, Mr. Brown? Why does he go the way he does? Is it because someone has to? Is it because no one else does? He disappears into a dark that only darkens the more. But he knows where he is going. Through the mange through those eyes through the dark he knows where he's going. He knows there is a destination. There is a destination to which he goes. And maybe someone has to. But I stop in the half-light, weighted heavily, red right hand. How much longer, Mr. Brown?</p>
<p>Feuer frei.</p>
<p>A flash of light and I hear no sound.    </p>
<p>There's that sick ether feeling in my stomach. Too much sleep. The light through the blinds through the window across the room fills it with gray and my skin burns against the sheet and the bed. I pull myself with infantile limbs from the hold to the window and let the light touch me. There's a silver ribbon, like a streamer, caught in the low branches of the tree there across the way and it oscillates there in the wind, and there's that certain spot in its movement where it catches the light and fills my eyes, fills the room, with this blinding glint whose apparition engrains itself in a way that is projected on the walls, the ceiling, the back of my eyelids when I look away. I lifted the blinds and cracked the window and took this first breath and took it deeply and I stretched out these feeble limbs and was washed in a warmth that ran down into my feet. <i>Arise now, arise, thou great Noontide.</i> There may yet come a moment for which you can answer.</p>

we can figure this out together.<br />
<br />
maybe.<br />

can you tell me how it would feel to wake up next to someone who was already awake?<br />

i’ve never called anyone baby other than a baby. i think that’s the best thing about me.<br />

i want bugs to crawl all over me.<br />

i want you to find my self breathing still in the woods and learn to leave me alone.<br />

at one time i dreamed up a life i wanted. it glimmered. it’s obtainable still. i catch glimpses sitting in second story cafes. airplanes. municipal busses and when i laugh at work.<br />
<br />
the window seats are the only things worth it.<br />
<br />
would you sit right by me and listen to my words? or would you cut me off, call me baby, keep me quiet at parties?<br />
<br />
i’ve been taught to keep quiet. i feel ashamed of everything i say.<br />
<br />
i’m only saying this because i’m sitting here yearning to know what your mouth cells taste like with my mouth cells.<br />

          <div><p>should I have given you my body<br />
when I was bleeding<br />
<br />
should I continue to give you my body<br />
over winter<br />
<br />
when I’m tender<br />
I almost love you<br />
<br />
we know because my body<br />
contains you<br />
<br />
feelings<br />
passed to me<br />
like steel balls<br />
meet bath pearls<br />
and gardenia steam<br />
<br />
I have acclimatised<br />
to these white hours<br />
<br />
abstracted<br />
my affections<br />
to the point of despair<br />
<br />
which layer is mine<br />
<br />
is it skin<br />
or warm water,<br />
foaming</p>

          <div><p><b>Little ghost</b><br />
<br />
grief can be milk<br /><br /></p>

<p>or it can be two boys standing at a window<br /></p>

<p>looking out at baby clothes<br /></p>

<p>left hanging on the washing line for weeks<br /><br /></p>

<p>can be a kind of fraying in the breeze<br /><br /></p>

<p>can be little blankets<br /></p>

<p>muslin sheets and little boots<br /></p>

<p>hanging in the air<br /></p>

<p>like little ghosts<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>At the truck-stop on the edge of town</b><br />
<br />
           we pull in with the gauge a line above empty<br /></p>

<p>out of fuel and out of money<br /></p>

<p>but Hercules gets out and fills the tank anyway.<br /></p>

<p>The pump churns like a bad heart,<br /></p>

<p>pulling blood from somewhere underneath our feet<br /></p>

<p>and through the screen I watch<br /></p>

<p>a thousand moths all hurl themselves<br /></p>

<p>against the god-lights, fall away in rapture<br /></p>

<p>then hurl themselves again.<br /></p>
<p align="right">
    Inside, a TV plays a rerun of The Green Berets.<br />

    Old John Wayne appears on screen, rifle in hand,<br />

    as Herc walks in like an empire of blood,<br />

    nods to the counter man,<br />

    counter-man nods back, Herc goes outside and sits and waits<br />

    for someone. And so we wait, long enough for old John Wayne<br />

    to press his mouth against a landscape,<br />

    to resurrect a myth then watch it burn again.<br />

    to become a gun, then a father,<br />

    then a mean drunk, then a gun again.<br />

    Long enough for old John Wayne<br />

    to swallow it and call it history,<br />

    to bleed a nation white,<br />
</p>
<p><br /><br />
Outside, a trucker pulls in and eyeballs Herc<br /></p>

<p>who looks clean through the world<br /></p>

<p>and sees a howling dark beneath it.<br /></p>

<p>Or perhaps he sees himself.<br /></p>

<p>Either way he nods to the trucker<br /></p>

<p>and they disappear around the corner.<br /></p>
<p align="right">
    On screen, old John Wayne gets cancer,<br />
    reaches his big hands down his big neck,<br />
    pulls out a sick lung, part of his stomach,<br />
    four white ribs, three sets of divorces papers,<br />
    the gun his second wife tried to shoot him with,<br />
    reaches further, pulls out more guns, a playboy interview,<br />
    the confederate flag,<br />
    white supremacy, a lynch mob, pulls out empire,<br />
    pulls out more guns,<br />
    reaches further in, pulls out genocide,<br />
    pulls out the trail of tears,<br />
    Wounded Knee, reaches further and further<br />
    til he can only pull himself from himself<br />
    and from himself he pulls the final scene from The Green Berets,<br />
    which is to say inside of John Wayne there is a small boy<br />
    who is always running out onto a greying beach.<br />
    The boy always calls for someone, finds no one calling back.<br />
    Old John Wayne always follows, takes the hand of the boy<br />
    says "you're what this is all about."<br />
</p>
<p><br />
Herc comes back then, fist full of bills and hard blank.<br /></p>

<p>He doesn’t look at me, doesn’t look at anything,<br /></p>

<p>just unfolds a bill and slides it to the counter-man.<br /></p>

<p>His whole body says it’s time for us to go<br /></p>

<p>as the air swells up like blood.<br /></p>

<p>Outside the morning breaks like a bad heart<br /></p>

<p>bleeding red across the sky<br /></p>
<p align="right">
    while old John Wayne and the boy -<br />

    they walk into horizon.<br />

    John Wayne and the boy -<br />

    they are walking into nothing.<br />
</p>
<p><br /><br /><br />
<b>At the coast, Hercules, least mortal of us all, tells the sea what it means to die.</b><br /><br />
Do you know the problem<br /></p>

<p>with all language?<br /><br /></p>

<p>How to speak of the dead.<br /><br /></p>

<p>“And so he died,<br /></p>

<p>went down into the ground<br /></p>

<p>or up into the air etc.”<br /><br /></p>

<p>But dying’s not a disappearing trick.<br /></p>

<p>There’s no trapdoor out the body.<br /></p>

<p>Death is the world under erasure.<br /></p>

<p>Proof that there was never anyone inside.<br /></p>

<p>You want a metaphor for dying?<br /></p>

<p>Take everything you ever wrote<br /></p>

<p>and burn it.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Then gather up and burn the ash.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Then burn the space that’s left behind.<br /><br />

<b>Interlude (2) / notes from an incomplete drama / 3rd person omniscient </b><br /><br />
<b>ACT 1</b><br /><br />
<i>Iphicles and the boy called C are imagined here as field and presence which is to say they are two shapes unfolding from a single plane which is to say something like the ‘immanence of one within its other’  which is to say that C already holds the whole of Iphicles inside his mouth. In any case, the scene is ext and the sky is blue, blue, blue.</i><br /><br /></p>

<p>C:   What’s it like living with all those bones?  <br /><br />
Iphicles: (<i>question mark</i>)  <br /><br />
C: Over the fence I mean. In the cemetery.<br /><br />
  Iphicles: (<i>small sound</i>)  <br /><br />
C:    You ever wonder what people look like after they go into the ground? I think they probably look like roots. Or water.<br /><br /> 
  Iphicles: (<i>smaller sound</i>)  <br /><br />
C: I wonder sometimes what my daddy would look like in the ground. Or maybe just his hands.  <br /><br />
Iphicles: (<i>the colour red</i>) (<i>a kind of static</i>)   <br /><br /><br />
<b>ACT 2</b><br /><br />
<b>SCENE 1  </b><br /><br />
<i>In the afternoon, C shows Iphicles a trick at the river. C lays belly down on the jetty, holds his hands beneath the water and starts to sing a gentle silverness. Within a minute a catfish has risen up and set its belly in his hands. C looks up. Smiles like a waking sky. Like an answer to the one big question. Iphicles thinks this is the most amazing thing he’s ever seen.</i><br /><br />
<b>SCENE 2  </b><br /><br />
<i>Later, as the sun sets and the empty of the house grows, Iphicles stands at the doorway looking out as C trip-traps his littleway away, away, we’re sad to say, and up the hill and as he goes everything becomes little and his little hands are the little thing that Iphicles will set his gaze on as he goes.</i><br /><br />
<b>SCENE 3  </b><br /><br />
<i>When C is gone from sight, the world comes back into a heaviness. Iphicles feels night falling over everything. He turns and climbs the stairs. In his room, he falls face down on his bed. Hugs nothing. The red noise in him swells. The house braces.</i><br /><br />
<b>ACT 3  </b><br /><br />
Iphicles: (<i>unpunctuated howl</i>)</p>

Half baked mountains observe the asphalt arteries we are pumping thru<br />

&amp; boredom’s burning coat of years<br />
trailing along the experiential embers <br />

There’s a prickly pear beer top in my pocket <br />

The next night we ate whale.”<br />

<p align="center">i.</p>
<p>A whale is inside of a whale.<br />Inside that whale is another whale.<br />Inside <i>that</i> whale? Me and Horace.<br />I call out to Horace, who’s currently trying to pry its jaw open. He’s one of these lughead types: all glamour muscle, clean-cut, neanderthal. His pride and joy is his willingness to resort to grunts and biceps.<br />“Dummy,” I say. “It’s a moot point. There are too many whales.”<br />He turns, gives up. “Bro,” he says. “Your pessimism might have helped you get a philosophy degree, but it won’t help here.”<br />“You’re wasting your strength,” I say, sitting cross-legged.<br />“Brosef,” Horace says. “We won’t get anything done if you keep sitting Indian-style and running your mouth.”<br />“It’s not Indian-style,” I say.<br />“We’re beyond politics,” Horace says. “Like we’re in a whale’s mouth, dude. There aren’t politics in here. And there sure as heck aren’t Indian people.”<br />“Three whales’ mouths.”<br />“Well,” he says. “That supports my point. We are far from Indian-folk.”<br />A rumble echoes up from the stomach. A burp? A fart? We lean in, listen.<br />Then, silence.<br />“False alarm,” Horace says.<br />I sigh and sit back down, not cross-legged.<br />“Anyway,” Horace says, and then stops talking.<br />“What? Anyway what?”<br />“I don’t know.”<br />“Ok.”<br />“Wanna play desert island?”<br />“No,” I say.<br />“Ok,” Horace says. “Let’s play Whale Mouth.”<br />“What the fuck is that?”<br />“It’s simple,” says Horace. “Name three things you’d bring into a whale’s mouth if you knew you’d have to be stuck there forever.” <br />“Three whales’ mouths,” I say. “And we won’t be here forever.”<br />“Is that optimism I hear?”<br />“Shut up.”<br />“I’ll go first,” Horace says. “Two thirty-five pound dumbbells, a six pack of Guinness, and a box of a dozen protein bars.”<br />“That was more than three things.”<br />“How?”<br />“Two dumbbells, six beers, and twelve protein bars? That’s like twenty things.”<br />“It <i>is</i> twenty things.”<br />“You said three.”<br />“Whatever,” Horace says, crossing his arms. “There is no math here, anyway.”</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p align="center">ii.</p>
<p>Call me Ishmael.<br />
Because that’s my actual name.<br />
I wash dishes at the brewery near the highway.<br />
Oh, and the answer is no: I’ve never read Moby Dick.<br />
I get a lot of those jokes.<br />
I want to be left alone.<br />
But of course, the new girl Tammy comes in a fucks with me, because of my name. She just graduated with a degree in American Literature, and now she works at a brewery because the job market is terrible, especially for people who study literature.<br />
Anyway, she rattles a cup of Starbucks Iced Coffee in my face.<br />
“Ok,” I say. “What.”<br />
“Get it?” she asks.<br />
“No.”<br />
“Starbucks.”<br />
“Ok?”<br />
“Starbuck.”<br />
“I got nothing.”<br />
“He’s a character in Moby Dick.”<br />
“Oh.”<br />
“And you’re the first sentence.”<br />
“Ok.”<br />
Tammy leans into the sink, sniffs. “It smells funny in these sinks.” She points down. “Like, it smells like legit antelope shit.”<br />
“Antelope shit?”<br />
“I don’t know. Fuck. Shit in general, I guess.”<br />
“Ok.”<br />
“You should clean them better.”<br />
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p align="center">iii.</p>
<p>Fourteen whales walk into a bar.
The bartender says, “We don’t allow whales in here.” To further convey his refusal to serve whales, he points to a sign that reads: “NO WHALES ALLOWED ANYMORE! NO SPERM WHALES, NO HUMPBACK WHALES...NO WHALES OF ANY KIND!!!!!!!!!”<br />
“Sorry,” the first whale says, turning to leave. <br />
“Sorry,” the second whale says, turning to leave. <br />
“Sorry,” the third whale says, turning to leave. <br />
“Sorry,” the fourth whale says, turning to leave. <br />
“Sorry,” the fifth whale says, turning to leave. <br />
“Sorry,” the sixth whale says, turning to leave.<br />
“Sorry,” the seventh whale says, turning to leave.<br />
“Sorry,” the eighth whale says, turning to leave.<br />
“Sorry,” the ninth whale says, turning to leave. <br />
“Sorry,” the tenth whale says, turning to leave. <br />
“Sorry,” the eleventh whale says, turning to leave. <br />
“Sorry,” the twelfth whale says, turning to leave. <br />
“Sorry,” the thirteenth whale says, turning to leave. <br />
The fourteenth whale, however, is quiet, contemplative. He is mad. He walks out of the bar, beats up a college kid, steals his clothes. He walks back into the bar, wearing a Red Sox hat and a polo from American Eagle.<br />
Inside the bar, trying to play it cool, he takes a seat. The bartender looks at him and smiles.<br />
“Welcome,” he says. “What are we having tonight?”<br />
“Gin and tonic.”<br />
“Any preference on the gin?”<br />
“Um,” the fourteenth whale says. “Beefeater, I suppose.”<br />
“Beefeater it is,” the bartender says.<br />
 The whale smiles, but before the drink can even be made, it hits him: he is a fraud, a loser, a bad friend, a whale. He stands up, feeling guilty that he is betraying his friends. He starts sweating, crying, swearing. He runs out of the bar, and the bartender says, “That guy was weird,” but the fourteenth whale doesn’t care. He jumps over the college kid, naked and passed out in the street, and sprints home. <br />
When he enters their apartment, the thirteen other whales look up and smile. They are drinking Fireball Whiskey and playing Mario Kart on WiiU. <br />
“We missed you,” the sixth whale says.<br />
“Yes,” says the eleventh. “We missed you a lot.”<br />
“Have a drink,” says the first whale.<br />
The fourteenth whale is moved to tears of joy by the sheer magnitude of kindness that surrounds him.<br />
<i>The moral of this story is if you have a 1,300 pound heart, fucking use it.</i>

I’d be like a gold camel, who takes only sips<br />

Here, there’s a birdhouse across the pulled water,<br />
behind the felled tree<br /><br />
that dipped in a windstorm<br />
that howled like an eagle.<br />
Gold eagle.<br /><br />

Napoleon sits, wears his laurels. He rots<br />

He’s mushed like the leaves<br />

I haven’t the hollow, prone, legible bones.”</p>

          <div><p>*<br /><br /></p>

<p>we are not living in the world.<br />
we are living in a map of the world. a world has been mapped for us. we are given the map as if it did not cover up something, as if there was nothing more. there was the world huge and vast and something that could only be brought to order, vaguely approximated for us to understand it. so we have a map.<br /><br /></p>

<p>*<br /><br /></p>

<p>Yes, you can think in binaries. but know that both are true. both are lying. become okay with this and you may exist within them and then one day you die and do not exist at all.<br /><br /></p>

<p>be happy right now.<br /><br /></p>

<p>*<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>**</strong><br /><br /></p>

<p>lets try to summarize.<br /><br /></p>

<p>we are on this rock, with our small window of the universe and our rock’s pattern of movement predicating our general actions and motivations and moods. this pattern and the placement of the rock we’re on within the universe and a whole bunch of other crazy tiny things, like bits you can’t see or feel are happening all together. and because of this, we are alive. struggling to find meaning in the world. crying all the fucking time. trying not to cry.  holding it in.  holding it together. trying to hold it together.<br /><br /></p>

<p>you see what i mean? everything is fucking horrible and everything is so fucking amazing you can’t even imagine it.<br /><br /></p>

<p>you aren’t drinking enough water, i just know it.<br /><br /></p>

<p>*<br /><br /></p>

<p>so people.  us. we. human beings.  living here on this rock.  feeling the change of the seasons, the pull of the tides.  the water in its various forms.  feeling all this every day for our whole lives until we die and don’t feel it anymore.<br /><br /></p>

<p>you know, sometimes it feels like we’re all already dead. do you ever feel that? like you’re dead already? like you have died. you are a ghost. you don’t feel the water inside you, the air around you. doesn’t it feel like you haven’t seen the sun in days? doesn’t it feel, sometimes, like you’ve never even really felt the sun at all.<br /><br /></p>

<p>and how many times a day do you realize you are breathing?<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>**</strong>*****<br /><br /></p>

<p>sometimes holding a conch shell to our ear is the closest we get to noticing our heartbeat and when it happens we mistake it for the sea.<br /><br /></p>

<p>sometimes we forget we are alive.<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>**</strong>**<br /><br /></p>

<p>so, the contents of this rock create change, beget change, if you will.  with varying states of water and climate, the contents of the rock force and are forced into change.<br /><br /></p>

<p>this change is awesome.  this change is hard and painful. <br /><br />
this is a slow change.  this is an infinite amount of changes occurring infinitely.<br /><br /></p>

<p>things just seem to work here, for some reason.  for some reason we have plants and we have animals.  the plants make something that the animals need to live and the animals make something that the plants need. how fucking coincidentally awesome is that.  so necessary, wow.  think about that or don’t think about it. you probably aren’t really understanding how amazing this is. thats ok (its not really ok).<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>*<br />
those moments of helpless clarity<br /><br /></p>

<p>sometimes in life there are small, brief moments of helpless clarity when we maybe stop for a second and realize:<br /><br /></p>

<p>our every day actions change the trajectory of humanity.  <br /><br /></p>

<p>but what can you do with heavy thoughts inside of a small cage? i hope you have cried today. its ok. i love you.<br /><br /></p>

<p>***<br />
said it before and i’ll say it again<br /><br /></p>

<p>weed. based. economy.<br />
*<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>picture:<br /><br /></p>

<p>a child crying at their birthday party, because they didn’t get the present they wanted, because the cake was chocolate and not vanilla, because a balloon loudly popped, because not enough of the cool kids showed up, because their father is dead and they just learned that no matter how many birthday cake candle wishes they reserve for wishing he would be alive, it is impossible.<br /><br /></p>

<p>every single reason is okay to cry about.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>***<br /><br /></p>

<p>sorry where were we?<br /><br /></p>

<p>Right,<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>Now I’m going to say something else that you are also going to ignore. its going to be VERY important. but you aren’t going to be amazed or moved or surprised. because its ‘obvious’, because you ‘already know this’, here it goes.<br /><br /></p>

<p>stop ignoring children.<br /> 
they are and always will be more important than you.<br /><br /></p>

<p>are you surprised? you don’t seem surprised. God do you remember being a child? a varied blend of insignificance and confusion, curiosity and vulnerability.  Children are important. Like wow.  They are tiny half formed humans.  They are potential and growth and contain limitless possibilities. Here are some song lyrics to back up my argument:<br /><br /></p>

<p>“teach your children well” - crosby stills nash &amp; young<br />
“I believe the children are our future” - whitney Houston<br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>SIDENOTE:<br /><br /></p>

<p>If this all sounds ridiculous or not important or anything other than very true and very important, let me just remind you that the mere fact i can use popular culture, i can use commodified song lyrics that were written with the express primary purpose of making a profit, yielding greater return than invested - that i can use these lyrics to prove a point, is frankly, alarming.<br /><br /></p>

<p>you are right to be afraid.<br /><br /></p>

<p>the world is completely fucked up.<br /><br /></p>

<p>the fact that popular culture like this contains truth. that there is truth being presented in a way that many people know, in a ubiquitous way. but that the truth is secondary, maybe not even a personal truth. but used for a very hollow primary purpose. used to gain capital. popularity. wealth. status. power. <br /><br /></p>

<p>if the media is telling us any truth at all<br />
they don’t believe in it themselves<br /><br /></p>

<p>and so we can’t either.<br /></p>

<p>we just can’t be expected (are intentionally not expected) to take the pleas of crosby stills nash and young seriously when we know crosby stills nash and young is looking out for crosby stills nash and young, not the children. crosby stills nash and young are getting paid.<br /><br /></p>

<p>we can consume and understand the truth within whitney houston’s statements but ultimately cast the notion’s importance aside via the capitalistic medium (and intention) that produced it<br /><br /></p>

<p>***<br /><br /></p>

<p>of course we are lonely, the planet is lonely. every night we have to look up in the sky and see things we will never touch or know or reach.  that is lonely.<br /><br /></p>

<p>*<br /><br /></p>

<p>***<br /><br /></p>

<p>Josh arrives in california<br /><br /></p>

<p>he is wary<br /><br /></p>

<p>it is dry <br /><br /></p>

<p>he gets off of a bus or out of a car or some vehicle that uses gasoline that has driven him to this point. it is the eighth of august two thousand sixteen and he is walking the rest of the way up to this monastery thing.<br /></p>

<p>it’s up a mountain and it’s pretty chill one of josh’s friends had said to josh. josh is thinking about this as he walks up the mountain. he wants to feel pretty chill. the world is ending.<br /><br /></p>

<p>along the way he sees pine trees and a somewhat barren landscape that is both alpine and desert.  it is alive but just barely and very rustic and josh does believe it will be chill.  <br /><br /></p>

<p>after about fifteen minutes at a steady incline the landscape begins to lose meaning. it becomes colors of muted greens and dark greens and ochres and beiges of several kinds and rectangles and triangles and thousands of pixels of shapes and colors. <br /><br /></p>

<p>Josh stops to smoke a pre rolled weed cigarette he has been keeping in a tin in his backpack as he sits under the dry shade of a large coniferous tree adjacent to the road he is following.<br /><br /></p>

<p>he resumes his walk up the steady incline towards the monastery on the mountain.<br /><br /></p>

<p>this seems chill he thinks<br />
and now<br /><br /></p>

<p>wow those trees are beautiful<br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>***<br /><br /></p>

<p>The cursory readings are unnecessary.  He knew. He knows. Key phrases and their outputs - quarterly, biannually, annually, biennially, quinquennially, centennially, decennially, quadranscentennially.  The data did not have to go back that far. <br /><br /></p>

<p>Boy it sure is beautiful outside.<br /></p>

<p>The trends have always been present, and consistent, and exponentially increasing.  Certain keystone shareholders preventing the implementation of recommended practice policies, or rather, recommended practice policies have been implemented by certain keystone shareholders. Local and global food generation statistics. Freshwater supplies.  Transportation costs. Material repository and/or golf course zoning statuses. <br /><br /></p>

<p>Between setting the dynamite, lighting the fuse and hiding from the explosion, at what point did you destroy something.  Was it you who actually destroyed it. How culpable in the destruction is the inventor of dynamite. The worker who built the dynamite, the worker who built the machine that built the dynamite. Is it destruction if your intention is creation.  if the explosion creates a mine, creates a tunnel.  <br /><br /></p>

<p>He knew. And he knew that everyone knew.  <br /><br /></p>

<p>Today can still be a good day.<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>**</strong><strong>**</strong>***<br /><br /></p>

<p>a sociological paper, written by karl marx<br /><br /></p>

<p>called utopia realized: a speculative study on the route to sustainable and equitable social harmony<br /><br /></p>

<p>this was found in a drawer.  <br /><br /></p>

<p>it had been eaten and piss stained by mice.  but here was his solution.  Very clearly, he wrote about the future, our past, present, maybe what was coming.  in light of everything going on, it was actually soothing.   news of this was soothing.  to know someone knew, someone saw this coming.  they saw past whatever was happening to us right now.<br /><br /></p>

<p>***<br /><br /></p>

<p>THIS CHAPTER IS ABOUT: PATTERNS <br /><br /></p>

<p>The concept of everything being everything else doesn’t just sound beautiful, its also freakishly true.  Everything is a pattern. We are the result of patterns and chain reactions.  If the fact that everyone has generally more or less ten fingers and ten toes and two arms and two legs is so blatantly obvious a pattern as to be ignored completely, it might help you to study the plants a while longer the next time you are outside. <br /><br /></p>

<p>Notice how the veins in the leaf of the tree look eerily similar to the branches and how the branches look eerily similar to the roots.  Now look at the veins in your hands.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Everything has a pattern. Try very hard to look for it.<br /><br /></p>

<p>The following is a brief list of examples of where these patterns can be found:<br /><br /></p>

<ul>
  <li>river networks<br /></li>
  <li>fault lines<br /></li>
  <li>mountain ranges<br /></li>
  <li>craters<br /></li>
  <li>lightning bolts<br /></li>
  <li>coastlines<br /></li>
  <li>mountain goat horns<br /></li>
  <li>trees<br /></li>
  <li>animal coloration<br /></li>
  <li>romanesco broccoli<br /></li>
  <li>pinapples<br /></li>
  <li>heart rates<br /></li>
  <li>heartbeats<br /></li>
  <li>earthquakes<br /></li>
  <li>snowflakes<br /></li>
  <li>psychological perception<br /></li>
  <li>crystals<br /></li>
  <li>blood vessels<br /></li>
  <li>ocean waves<br /></li>
  <li>DNA<br /></li>
  <li>soil pores<br /></li>
  <li>rings of saturn<br /><br /></li>
</ul>

<p>they are everywhere<br />
*<br /></p>

<p>sometimes. when i look outside, into nature. i see only the patterns that nature makes. <br /><br /></p>

<p>its sometimes so difficult to process the world for how it is, for how each thing is so unique, how can this uniqueness exist. how does this go on like this.  how can there be so many flowers. how can there be so many winged insects. any wings at all.  <br /><br /></p>

<p>but each thing has a pattern so similar to the next.  we may not be able to process everything for how it is, but we can understand the simple additive motion of how it has become.  <br /><br /></p>

<p>and its all a variation of the same thing.<br /><br /></p>

<p>***<br /><br /></p>

<p>A STEP BACK: NATURE AND THE ELEMENTS HOW WE OVERLOOK THE STARS AND ALL THE REST OF IT: AN INFORMAL REVIEW <br /><br /></p>

<p>so there are four season we go through, winter spring summer fall<br /><br /></p>

<p>four elements we need for survival, earth air water and fire <br /><br /></p>

<p>no this isn’t everything, don’t say oh there’s more, yeah i know there’s more, there’s always more.<br /><br /></p>

<p>but this is the least we have and need. the very fucking least. we have these things and we need them.  the seasonal changes and shifts.  the coincidental necessity and availability of the elements to create life in myriad forms. <br /><br /></p>

<p>so it just so happens we have these things. absolutely ridiculous chances of this happening if you ask me.  <br /><br /></p>

<p>i mean my god, the moon, have we talked about the moon yet?? the sun? have we gotten to the sun? <br /><br /></p>

<p>there is so much to get too i’m afraid we won’t have time for it all.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>**<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>life is oscillations<br />
concentric circles<br />
spirals<br />
infinity signs<br />
loops<br />
you spend your life in cycles <br />
of cells<br />
of relationships<br />
of moods<br /><br /></p>

<p>you spend your life escaping and entering <br />
you spend your life in a state of change <br />
that is itself a paradox<br /></p>

<p>the state is change, the change is consistent<br />
have you ever watched a wave move before<br />
its like that<br />
the crest of the wave <br />
the way something can be carried<br />
the way it carries itself<br />
consistently changing<br />
somehow cohesive in shape <br />
in direction<br />
in form<br />
but<br />
the wave is not the water<br />
the water is constantly changing<br />
inside the wave<br />
the water <br />
the same water <br />
becomes the next wave<br />
the wave moves through the water<br />
it is a constant state of change<br />
it is a constant<br /><br /></p>

<p>we build lives in order to begin new lives<br /><br /></p>

<p>that is the hope<br />
that is the goal<br /><br /></p>

<p>that is the ideal <br /><br /></p>

<p>we build our lives hopefully in order to trade them in for new lives <br />
we build ourselves whole <br />
and then (ideally)<br />
we find someone who has also built themselves whole (ideally)<br />
who loves the whole we have built as perfectly as possible<br />
and then <br />
it is dissolved away.<br />
we begin a new life with someone, we begin a relationship<br /><br /></p>

<p>again we start to work on our life together in order to trade it in for a new life<br />
we work on bringing both halves of each other <br />
we have somehow found together into a whole<br />
we build security for ourselves, we build functionality (ideally)<br />
we build ourselves as tightly together as possible (ideally)<br />
as perfectly as possible<br />
and then <br />
it is dissolved away.<br />
we begin a new life together, with a child <br /><br /></p>

<p>this is the best. case. scenario.<br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>this child will watch us die.<br />
hopefully.<br /><br /></p>

<p>you are building something and it is always changing and it is almost already gone and this is life.<br /><br /></p>

<p>this is the goal<br />
to build something as well as it can be built<br />
so it is ready to be destroyed as it becomes something else<br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>this is the ideal<br />
and nothing in reality is ever the ideal.<br /><br /></p>

<p>*<br /><br /></p>

<p>NOBODY KNOWS HOW A BUTTERFLY WORKS<br />
NOBODY KNOWS HOW IT DISSOLVES ITSELF<br />
HOW IT REMEMBERS TO BECOME SOMETHING INSTINCTIVELY<br />
THAT IS HAS NEVER BEEN BEFORE<br />
NOBODY KNOWS HOW IT CAN DESTROY ITSELF<br />
WITH SUCH PRECISION AS TO BECOME SOMETHING <br />
THAT CAN FLY AWAY <br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>*<br /><br /></p>

<p>NOBODY KNOWS HOW A BUTTERFLY WORKS BUT IT PROBABLY WORKS JUST LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE <br /><br /><br /><br /></p>

          <div><p><b>Aliens Exist</b><br /><br />
I left my baby in the back of a Blink-182 song. If you looped and stretched a pop punk song like 80 times you could have a drone masterpiece. Every genre should have a drone counterpart. Books should, or they already did, and that's called conceptualism. Do you think Blink-182 is good horseback riding music though? I could canter. Explanation is information. Worshipper Rips Out Both Eyes In Mass With His BARE HANDS. My roommate hasn't paid the utility bill in 3 months and we've just been casting about with military-grade glowsticks. It's funny because it's true. You can see the neon from the outside. Maybe someone will think it's a signal. Are The Streets of Washington, D.C. Supposed To Form A Pentagram? I can feel the pendulum pitting my stomach. Hairline fractures are in style. I felt a jolt when I realized I was gonna look back on this as A Memory. then I skittered back into the warmdark haze. Aliens, those were one of Lisa Frank's motifs, right? Apart from everything else she excelled in making things outsize. I do, too. Aliens with sloth or gorilla eyes. Fear as a praxis. Fear as a mediating principle. Fear for president! NASA Whistleblower: Alien Moon Cities Exist. Did you say this was a no flex zone or a no fly zone? There is a finite amount of dust in the universe and you're just displacing it when you dust. Dust dust, lol. Nostalgia is a gauzy medium. Bad people who taught me good things. It's about having a worldview that internally justifies itself. Daisy-chaining your way into coherence. Malevolence is banal. How To Survive Falling From A Plane. How dare you detain my friend for wearing a Jenny Holzer t-shirt. He won't read this. I have sources from the government. I have informants wearing Big Dogs t-shirts. These Big Dog Colors Don't Run. My brain in an oil rig. One Nation Under Drones. Bring lawyers, guns, and money. Seriously, what the fuck is catnip. Who are we? Where are we going? How do we communicate with you? And yea, the gates of hell will slowly open, and who among you will consider yourself unfit to enter. FBI's Newest Gang Threat: Insane Clown Posse Fans. They place the conspiracy, just like 9/11. Quote from Blink-182 New Album 2014: "Tom cared more about searching for UFO's than making music with the world famous blink-182" (end quote). With the world famous blink-182. With the world-famous blink-182. Starcraft. Storycraft. Babycore. Decamp for Detroit. Can someone turn me into a building? Or a lunchbox? Please take this case more serious and stop being ignorant to the law of universe...this is a warning. I walked in the wrong direction once and got upset. To be sure, there are people with hobgoblins in their heads. Strange times, Mister Jones. Strange times indeed.</p>

You have to capture the scene<br />

Here’s to strange rooms and blood <br />
that sludges out with no place in mind.<br />
It’ll teach you how to walk among <br />
the basement dwellers; how to grab <br />
at the unknowns with vigor; how to hold<br />
together among the spider web cracks. <br />
Today feels marigolds &amp; daisies, baby.<br />
Fits of citrus feeling, all uncut wood/<br />
ungodly twinge—figure it out in the corners <br />
of you. Keep saying your name into the mirror.<br />
Summer socks hold nervous tapping,<br />
you leave out my nickname. <br />
I’m still counting the time as evidence<br />

Mariposa: your face slackens, molten gold mouth<br />
spilling constancy. Show up burning,<br />

<p>I was Googling how to write a resume when I learned that a friend had vanished, weighed down by her hair. At the memorial service her incomplete collection of state flowers was briefly on display. Music streamed from microcomputers hidden among the attendees. It must have been Bach, the palest blues sung by man. The eulogist, a horse-faced Brit with a plummy accent, recited eight explosive facts about orgasms. No one but me seemed to think it strange that beneath our chairs the rats just went on building their maze.

<p>The young X-ray tech wears her hair short like Joan of Arc. She says,  &quot;Just do what the machine says.&quot; Is this real? The machine says in not an impolite voice, &quot;Breathe in and hold your breath.&quot; It’s precisely the sort of difficulty that appeals to generals and kings. Nearby but out of sight a woman meets the man who received her dead brother’s face. Oh, if only I could get a pretty accomplice to slip over the border with me!

<p>Roses and mirrors kept following her. Roses at her feet, roses on the neighboring steps, roses next to garbage. The mirror in her dreams, before it she twirled, but every omen was hazy. A tired mouth opening and closing. A mouth fruitlessly spitting out grains of sand.<br /> <br />I feel like a little boat beaten about by the sea, she said. She said this to herself a lot.<br /> <br />Thoughtful and sad as one should be. She could not sleep. It was a dreadful thing to love a shadow. She covered herself and wandered. Steeled from people asking questions.<br /> <br />She looked out at the road at the line where the sun passes that she was always heading toward and didn't know why. Careful of each step.<br /> <br />Then a stranger appeared down the road. Looking like an old tree all overgrown with moss decked with oak­-leaves.<br /> <br />The stranger stood and watched from a distance. He recognized her gait. The stranger had heard things. The stranger wanted to know for sure. He rushed at her and whispered in her ear. She withdrew and they fought. He fell.<br /> <br />Rise or I shall kill you, she said.<br /> <br />Grass trampled stained with blood. They smote and thrust and smote again. He gathered strength and struck a terrific blow. To kill her quite but it sheared the front of her helmet. Her face uncovered.<br /> <br />Her arm dropped. The sword fell from her hand. She tried to speak roughly to him. Her tongue would not say the words.<br /> <br />Hot and pink. And her hair. So long reached her feet. Burst from its band. Her face strewn like a golden frame.<br /> <br />They stayed. They were still.<br /> <br />They rested and their wounds healed until at last he could stay no longer silent.

          <div><p>Growing up, from swing set<br />

pool, only bent circles<br />
with no net, metal hoops<br />
nothing<br />

Not ask, because what’s grammar.<br />
What manners? We’re neighbors.<br />
Our fathers carpool.<br />

On Fridays after work they drink<br />
together, sink bottles <br />
under<br />
steel-toed boots<br />
away from trashcans and wives<br />
and throw attention at neither<br />
except when there are messes<br />
to clean up.<br /><br />

What’s missing is replaced<br />
by what is there. <br /><br />

A living beat, rhythmic and organic our poetry<br />

Rotten, hulled in our own battling skin, <br />

Blackened spew forked our third eye blind.<br />
Hooked to the screw of pills murmuring us to keep calm.<br />
Dying inside trying, can't walk in the open<br />

Shredded to worn, almost choking in the swarming <br />

Feasting on cold bodies blue, <br />
eating the faces off of the unmindful.<br />
Our feet in the gruel of grey maggots, black cadavers<br />
and soft sad tissues. <br />
We are tricked, taken for a ride whenever <br />
we are to transpire tiredness from this horrid immoral reality.<br />
Nutmeg scattered on our nerves. <br />

Witnessing our own self into the suction to not turn it off.<br />

My success is unbelievable: from a poor kid growing up in a house with a one car garage to an enormously successful owner of a house with a two car garage, I’ve come a long way, baby, as Fatboy Slim likes to proclaim.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>I want to inspire those budding real estate brokers, agents, and other happy-go-lucky members of the real estate bound. Real estate agents are the makers of dreams. Every time I sell real estate to people I try to make sure it is a good fit for the buyer. That means really understanding the buyer. Below are a few tips I would like to give in order to truly understand your potential buyer. Yes I know it can be a bit tricky but real estate sales is an industry with a rich and exciting history beginning in Ancient Mesopotamia with the original real estate sold by particularly clever cats. Eventually in the world moved onto selling real estate by actual humans not much later in the early 19th century.</p>
<p>While I don’t want to get into a history lesson I do feel it helps to learn a thing or two from feline friends. People like to claim dogs are best friends, but dogs are not well-suited for real estate sales. Dogs are well-suited for farm equipment sales and in fact the founder of John Deere was a dachshund who emigrated from Germany in the late 19th century with only a single baggie to his name, to use exclusively for picking up his own defecation. Cats on the other hand might not move quickly all the time (or even maintain consciousness for over twelve minutes) but they are observant creatures, meowing at intruders which really throws intruders off their intruding game. In fact cats are one of the key points of my guide to selling real estate so let’s get started with that fantastic guide.</p>
<p>Buy a cat - this is an important first step to understand the real estate game. Cats and purchasers of real estate have a lot in common: both enjoy hardwood floors, sleeping and are hydrophobic. The observation of cats has helped me enormously in selling real estate. </p>
<p>Integrity is Key! - I am honest with my clients, unlike a certain now disbarred real estate agent named Rick. While Rick might have done other bad things (taken my parking spot, bought my favorite kind of Lipton Tea just to spite me, and shown a clear distaste for the short-lived series “Freaks and Geeks”) he acted without integrity in selling real estate. Essentially, if there are problems with a piece of property then it is up to the agent to let the buyer know. Rick, for example, sold a piece of real estate without advising the buyer that the home had a penchant for housing ghosts. Suddenly the buyer realized that they had all those ghosts to handle and worse yet, only two out of the six ghosts paid rent. </p>
<p>No Geodesic Domes - this is an impossible thing to sell. Very few people like living in domes exclusively. I realize that domes adorn some of the greatest buildings across the world but they serve usually as a neat cherry on top of a beautiful building, not the main course. I mean, imagine eating an entire meal of cherries. At first it would be cool like “Alright! Yummy cherries” but then it would get boring. That is exactly what living in a geodesic dome is all about. </p>
<p>Know the kind of house - geography defines a house. Every part of the country is different. I live and work on Long Island, the best part of New York State. I know of Long Island’s unique real estate housing stock, particularly that beautiful creation, the Splanch. Not quite a ranch, not quite a splash, it is a thing that is a true wonder to behold. Other parts of the country have their own quirks and knowing them is knowing the buyer is knowing how to sell. </p>
<p>Always Be Hugging - there’s some movie starring Alec Baldwin (or maybe he is in a scene or two) where he informs people to “Always Be Hugging” because buyers enjoy hugs. Later on in that movie, which I believe is called “Glengarry Ross” they are able to sell by hugging people, specifically Al Pacino who breaks down crying out of joy about getting hugged. So remember to always hug because hugs have saved lives before, over 500 lives specifically in a small Swedish fishing during the Swedish ABBA period. Hugs are an essential part of the real estate sales world and I don’t know where I would be if I couldn’t hug people. </p>
<p>Could I say more about the real estate profession? I want to and I hope to continue to inform individuals about the real estate world via my Facebook. I implore people to add me as a friend on that highly diversified social media platform. My goal is to make the real estate world accessible to all. Real estate is my life and I hope it becomes yours someday!</p>

<p>I told my mother I’ve been waiting for rain and like any inkling I let it splash across my day’s page and take it full to the brim because the outside pavement is moist with weather and my apartment dimmed like it always does in the moments between sunset and rain and on the third day of course it rained somewhere other than my face because I’d been sleeping so harshly the last two days and I sleep like I cry like an infant that’s lost it’s mother in the same room or a toy right at it’s feet right out of it’s reach and tomorrow you leave for unseen lands and I stay in a place I now get to imagine without you and like anything important my heart pounds against my chest at the thought and you will come back and then I will leave and then I will come back and you will leave and then the time will come when we are in the same place at the same time and we will recount the memories the other did not see and the stories we tell will fall off our lips the same way the rain is off mine now off of the balcony where I still keep the same box full of empty cans of beer we drank that November night you told me you wanted to visit Sweden one day and I refused to kiss you but I held you so tightly as if the night would try and steal you away from me that maybe my arms would shield you from the bad memories and my arms had no tattoos then but two tattoos and many storms later I have fallen in love with your complexities and the way you shattered when I told you that it would be okay<br /><br /></p>

<p><b>06/22/15</b><br /><br /></p>

<p>It rained last week on the same day I wrote that message to myself because the weather knows the in’s and out’s of the string that binds us that sometimes wraps our fingertips too tight there is too much blood rushing into my hands when I ask how you are through a screen and I’ve been sitting upside down on my wall again trying to get it to flow to my heart trying to make my heart stop doing all the work and I flip my body to try and flip my realities you told me that last year was the lowest point in your life and I didn’t know what to feel and I miss the way I felt myself melt when you pointed out the cracks in my nail polish or the smell of dinner on your stove I haven’t done dishes in weeks I take pills to save money and you are unemployed and you want to make sounds that run in 2/4 time and I want to show you the way noise runs fault lines through my brain all static and sonic booms and the overcast of the buildings that loom in my bedroom window I am not sure if you are in love but you are swooning and I am swooning for so many things all of the time and now I am not open I am terrified I tell our friends I am not in love with you anymore but it’s the same principle for when I said I didn’t like emo when I got into John Cage I am still screaming those lyrics in my car alone and I am still reaching for your ribcage in the dark your skin nestled tight and soft against it the moisture from the humid southern summer layers our affections and I am still navigating the meaning of not wanting anything in return from someone that carries a piece of your soul with them for the rest of their lives</p>

          <div><p>“What’s the most fun you can have&lt;/br&gt;
with bending light?” he wants to know&lt;/br&gt;</p>

<p>as we sit on the banks of the Rainy River&lt;/br&gt;
watching sunbeams break into rainbows.&lt;/br&gt;</p>

<p>I shrug, throw some bread out onto the water&lt;/br&gt;
and we watch small fish leap and thrash.&lt;/br&gt;</p>

<p>Suddenly his face is filled with light,&lt;/br&gt;
his hair ablaze with honey-gold.&lt;/br&gt;</p>

<p>Then, shadows of clouds and a quick cold&lt;/br&gt;
ripple of wind. His hands burn red,&lt;/br&gt;</p>

<p>and as the waves shorten all through&lt;/br&gt;
the spectrum, orange, green and all the rest,&lt;/br&gt;</p>

<p>until they pulse ultraviolet, as he turns&lt;/br&gt; 
to shield my face from x- and gamma rays.&lt;/br&gt;</p>

<p>When clouds pass, air warms around us as&lt;/br&gt; 
sunshine glides softly over the long river’s&lt;/br&gt;</p>

<p>curl. He smiles, his face starlit, his shining&lt;/br&gt; 
hands soaked, transformed by mystery and joy.&lt;/br&gt;</p>

          <div><p>Has anyone died by<br />
watching things sit<br />
on water? By skipping<br />
a flat rock across water?<br />
Or trying to sit on water?<br />
We are not birds.<br />
Has anyone died before<br />
seeing beautiful things<br />
on the surface of a lake?<br />
You. Did you at least get<br />
a chance to look at the<br /> 
clouds? Those balloons<br />
won’t hold very long.<br />
You don’t need oxygen<br />
after passing the first<br />
atmosphere. The balloon<br />
will pop and you’ll be<br />
Up There, waiting.<br />
You’ll watch a bright dead<br />
gas fall and take your place.<br />
You will feel something<br /> 
electric and soon your<br />
bones will change from<br />
white to blue. What used<br /> 
to be your body will inflate<br />
and glow. Nothing will be<br />
able to touch you again.<br />
Has anyone ever lived<br />
through turning into concrete?<br />
No, but it’s intense. I will<br />
look up at you and rent a<br /> 
light machine to send you<br /> 
a message: I know you are<br /> 
lonely right now<br />
but I have ideas.<br /></p>

<p><b>I Am Moving Into A New House &amp; Flipping All Of The Lightswitches On To Prove That I Am Capable Of Being Alive by Beyza Ozer</b><br /><br />
but i do not feel alive &amp; it’s taken me a few years to get here. the walkway is slippery with old tears &amp; the front porch hasn’t stopped dripping blood for approximately eight days. who do i talk to about this? the government?<br /><br />
i did not ask to die this way. i’m wondering what kind of clothing my parents would bury me in. they would pick a dress even though i had asked multiple times to be cremated. mom PLEASE shoot my ashes into space. beyza, what kind of a daughter are you?<br /><br />
i don’t want worms in my veins. paper cuts on eyes are something i will never stop crying over. feeling sand in between my toes reminds me of fucked up summers. i do not feel alive &amp; i don’t want to be dead.<br /><br />
no one wants to live here. no one wants to make a home in the back of my throat. i want ghosts for neighbors, in theory.</p>
