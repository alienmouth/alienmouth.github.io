        <h1>What Was It</h1>
        <h2>Ron Gibson</h2>
    	
        <p>As I stood on the deck of a ferry, wind against my face, slicing<br />
through dark waters under blue sky, I thought about things on the<br />
borderlands of possible and impossible, like digitally-manipulated<br />
art. You seemed to be all around me: in the giggles of children, in<br />
the conversation of lovers, in the cries of hungry seagulls, as they<br />
conducted aerial maneuvers for alms.</p>

<p>I thought about beginnings and endings, and yesterdays and nows and<br />
tomorrows, and I could feel you there, a presence just beyond the<br />
periphery. Everything shouted, but only I could hear your name in the<br />
thick throats, in the sea hiss, in the engine rumble. I heard you<br />
somewhere over the Olympic mountain range, past the mountain goats<br />
past the snowcaps; you were where the sun lays down to die, and I<br />
thought of you dreaming by its side, content, full of love and loved<br />
in full.</p>

<p>Later, in the ferry terminal, I read fictional constructs from another<br />
time, from another place, and there was a certain heat in their<br />
fictional lives that felt familiar, that felt reflective of us,<br />
without actually being us.</p>

<p>I tried to explain to myself what ‘was,’ but still could not explain<br />
what ‘is.’ It was some foreign word on the tongue without translation;<br />
a novel not yet fully conceived; it was a song yet to be heard by<br />
ears, and it was the sonic boom that filled the skies with your<br />
pounding heart, as metal spires loomed into view on the horizon,<br />
growing larger and larger with your bright welcomes, until the sight<br />
was more than any one man could take.</p>
