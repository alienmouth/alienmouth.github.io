            <p>by Kate Monica</p></br></br>
            <p><b>Fun War</b><br><br>
            she says ‘you are officially the first thing<br>
            i think of,’ her mouth a line, as if<br>
            i am condemned. i am so okay<br><br>

            with that. what was i just gonna say. a girl<br>
            at my summer camp went to an alternative high school <br>
            and wore tank tops because she wasnt worried about anybody seeing<br><br>

            rain speckles your face all silver when you tell me <br>
            we both missed the deadline <br>
            for the internship application. i think that it will be okay<br><br>

            but i am always wrong. a fortune teller gleans <br>
            out of a glass orb<br>
            a future you disagree with. <br>
            i dont have to know what happens to know<br><br>

            i disagree with the traffic light on a night <br>
            she and i are in the backseat<br>
            together, both internally warring over whether or not <br>
            to place a hand<br>
            you said it’s not too late for me but to be careful<br>
            i said ‘with what’<br>
            you said ‘be careful’ <br>
            &amp; my brain turned <br>
            to a claw clasping &amp; unclasping <br>
            until you texted back with more clarity <br><br>

            i don’t think i feel like it<br>

            i want her to think i am a whimsical person<br>
            but i don’t have any posters in my room right now and it resembles an asylum<br><br>

            i think, i don’t know<br>
            i’ve never seen one from the inside<br>
            next time she comes over<br>
            i will tell her that</p><br><br>

            <p><b>It Is In Everyone’s Best Interest</b><br><br>

            i liked her instantly because she had a picture of her mom as her profile picture<br>
            there are only erratic ways to measure tenderness &amp; i think that’s how<br>
            it should feel when someone is bashful in an honest way, not just<br>
            because it’s cute and fun to draw people<br>
            closer to the person they would be if no one had ever said anything<br>
            when you are in the room i feel it in my back teeth as a kind of metallic ringing, <br>
            chewing on the aluminum of you saying hi to other people first <br>
            it is impossible not to fall in love with someone when they tell you the story<br>
            of the afternoon they stood in their backyard looking small above<br>
            the acorns littering the lawn, moving again and again<br>
            the hair from their face<br>
            it is impossible not to fall in love<br>
            at one point or another, but you have to try not to<br>
            ruin your perception of each other in this way; i idealize girls into gods<br><br>

            and feel betrayed when they can’t enact a flood whenever i want &amp; <br>
            boys and girls do this to me &amp; boys and girls do this to each other &amp; boys<br>
            &amp; boys pull at each other to see who makes more of a predator &amp; girls<br>
            &amp; girls pull at each other to see if anyone really loves anyone for the inside<br>
            i click through her profile pictures and wish we could be friends but<br>
            there are only insolent ways to distract yourself, or i always<br>
            feel so kind from a distance</p><br><br>


            <p><b>Whenever Someone Asks If I’ve Been Skinny Dipping I Say Yes But I Haven’t</b><br><br>
            depending on how far you zoom out it is easier to absorb any sized tragedy<br>
            i havent watched the news in two months<br>
            you cant make me <br><br>

            i have enough to fear &amp; tread above<br>
            not frantic, just moving<br>
            so as to avoid touching the awful slimy thing w/ my foot<br>
            or whatever else is at the bottom of a lake so big<br><br>

            it’s been a while since i’ve seen you and you were not happy to see me<br>
            i’m not mad, i know you’ve been busy organizing your future by color<br>
            it’s just another thing to notice<br>
            get my head wet last, wait til everyone else goes first<br>
            but generally someone has to dunk me, two open hands <br>
            on my shoulders &amp; laughter that blurs once underwater <br><br>

            longer i hold my breath down here the more<br>
            my lungs fill with steel, cold tug &amp; shrapnel<br>
            you sent me a series of snapchats of you at ArtSpace in Hartford<br>
            i am uncultured and didn’t understand what i was looking at <br>
            but i liked the exhibit with all the red bowls<br>
            full of red flowers</p></br></br></br></br>
