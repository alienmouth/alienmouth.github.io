          <div><p>If we were entirely made by thread, I’d be the red yarn. <br />
There is something about rods and cones <br />
that doesn’t seem to like danger. They work like facets on diamonds, <br />
sample lipstick at the grocery, white letters on stop signs; <br />
like the word “caramel” when I say it. <br />
God, I just want to be important. I just want to be someone real. <br />
The early autumn leaves have me thinking deep crimson hue is only okay <br />
when it’s fifty miles early and I should’ve expected it. People don’t like that color: <br />
it’s like being hit in the face with a shit-ton of bricks, and nobody wants <br />
to be met with something real. <br />
What’s the fun in being real when you have to prove it? Let’s see, <br />
I have a dog. When I was four I stepped on a nail and had it taken out with tweezers; <br />
when I was seventeen I glued cigarettes into scrapbooks. When I was old enough <br />
to call bullshit on Andy Warhol, I made a choker out of tabs off Campbell’s chicken noodle soup and a severed G string from my guitar. Sometimes,<br />
I sit in bed and wonder how to shed eyelashes <br />
and the effects of antidepressants on women taking birth control. <br />
World history probably warned me about this: <br />
being a bitch is like manhandling a group project, <br />
everyone drowns you in praise ‘til you fuck up. I’m waiting for you to smoke it off.<br />
I’m waiting for you to stare at the sea ‘til you’re positive there’s something there.<br />
Under all these deeply damaged layers of artificial material and cheaply-crafted plastic,<br />
there’s something there, and I can’t believe it’d take a bachelor’s degree to see it.<br /></p>

          <div><p>there are subtle sweaters my mind knits you.<br /><br />
they are <em>purple</em> when you walk<br />
<em>red</em> when you take your shoes off<br /><br />
when i find printed socks i weave them in,<br />
and drip sweet old sesame oil between the hairs and the knit. <br /><br />
there are subtle sweaters my teeth build you,<br /> 
after i brush them too,<br />
when i don’t speak and it’s mostly in february<br /><br />
what is it about the letters f ‘ruary’<br />
that squeezes in love<br />
through the cushions?</p>

          <br><span class="smaller">by Carl Boon on May 1, 2017</span>  <br/>
          <div><p>Already in August the bees<br />
had gone to ground, <br />
burrowing for rain. <br />
Already we knew<br />
many things of winter,<br />
the frozen doorsteps,<br />
the slush on Third Street.<br /><br />
The mower’s blade,<br />
unsharpened since my father’s death,<br />
startled two who rose and stung—<br />
the light of pain, the annoying<br />
thought that I was wrong—<br />
being there, a blaze<br />
of flesh, a man.<br /><br />
We have our flannel<br />
and our heated rooms, <br />
hot water and the hour of sleep<br />
before we leap <br />
into the day, things to fracture<br />
and collect, things to heed.<br />
The bees are still, memorial,<br /><br />
the winds of Illinois <br />
only they can hear. <br />
Already they knew<br />
in August the squalls of snow<br />
off Lake Erie, the dents<br />
men make <br />
as they perfect the land.<br /></p>

          <br><span class="smaller">by Angie Sijun Lou on April 26, 2017</span>  <br/>
          <div><p>It’s night one of Aquarius season<br />
&amp; the road is bleached with moon<br />
&amp; spit. I’m looking at my bangs<br />
crusted like a helmet to my face.<br />
I’m looking to kill the president<br />
of the USA—if not the tower, the<br />
hallway, if not his ghost, his hands.<br />
A boy told me once he thought all<br />
girltears were black cause he only<br />
saw his sister cry with mascara on,<br />
that same eye leaking &amp; leaking.<br />
I told him god is a 12 year old girl<br />
leaking all her hidden bitter tears<br />
on a kitchen table.<br /><br />
When I was 12 a nice white lady<br />
mistook me for her adopted<br />
daughter every day after school.<br />
She thought I looked just like her<br />
from the back but I know what<br />
I look like: a lotus flower with a<br />
sideways cunt, lying facedown on<br />
my bedroom floor remembering<br />
how bright animal eyes shine when<br />
they are reflected in car eyes. My<br />
mom doesn’t believe in abortions<br />
so she mailed me to Shanghai with<br />
a suitcase filled with breastmilk<br />
as soon as I was born. There are no<br />
stars in the womb but the stars in<br />
Amerika glimmer like cruel babies<br />
in the rain.<br /><br />
Last night I dreamt of a wet block<br />
of tofu falling down an escalator,<br />
step by step, into a shallow eternity.<br />
I know it meant nothing but it went<br />
on all night long. At the end of this<br />
escalator I witnessed god sitting<br />
at a kitchen table. She wants to know<br />
if Amerika is as holy as the textbooks<br />
say &amp; I tell her: Amerika is<br />
a swimming pool filled with spit,<br />
a pile of puke on the nativity scene,<br />
a limp dick on Snapchat,<br />
an artificial plant dying under<br />
a depression lamp &amp; I<br />
have been instructed to build<br />
a synthetic ontology in all<br />
the holy spaces left behind.<br /></p>
