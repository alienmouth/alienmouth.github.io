          <div><p><strong>Purge #1</strong><br />
<br />
The rain wrote <br />
rhythms on your<br />
bathroom window,<br />
begged, let<br />
me in, but<br />
it could never<br />
cleanse you<br />
like the sound<br />
of the toilet<br />
flushing<br />
your 550 calorie<br />
dinner.<br />
<br />
<strong>Purge #2</strong><br />
<br />
Your neck nearly snapped<br />
when you whipped your head back<br />
toward me, fingers<br />
still pressed<br />
against the toilet.<br />
<br />
<strong>Crumb</strong><br />
<br />
If I eat less they’ll love me If I eat less they’ll think I’m beautiful If I eat less they’ll stop staring at my plate My stomach My sausage-link fingers And maple syrup-sweat stained armpits Stop staring at me like split-pea soup spills out of my mouth each and every time I try to talk Expecting me to cry and cry and cry and cry and cry and thank them as they tell me they’re worried about me Eating my food Their food Everybody’s God damn food If I eat less they’ll love me If I eat less they’ll think I’m beautiful If I eat less they’ll win then I’ll look like them I don’t want to look like them I want to look like me If I eat less they’ll flick flick flick me off the table I’ll eat less until I’m nothing but a crumb<br />
<br />
<strong>Ukulele</strong><br />
<br />
Luke gave me his mom’s Newports.<br />
She hid them in the bathroom, buried<br /> 
beneath body towels because<br />
she lied—told her family she quit<br />
after surviving Breast Cancer.<br />
<br />
I took them to school with me,<br />
zipped up in the front pocket<br />
of my backpack.<br />
<br />
I sold them to the alley kids<br />
for a dollar a smoke because<br />
they needed something<br />
to look forward to, and<br />
I needed money<br />
to buy a ukulele.<br /></p>

          <div><p>Imagining what my life might have looked like if I’d been<br />
undersexed: a junkie, perhaps, or someone who made<br />
a great deal of money. The branch is bare where the kitten<br />
once clung, its eyes telling me to hang in there. Or was it<br />
me, imploring the kitten (&amp; why should I wish for the<br />
kitten to let go)? We must all hang in there together, <br />
or assuredly we will all hang in there separately. <br />
They sang about chasing the dragon, but it was just <br />
a kitten, purring in the wilderness. Where there’s smoke, there’s <br />
a dragon, &amp; where there’s kitsch, there’s a kitten. Imagining <br />
what life might have looked like if there hadn’t been nine of them.<br />
Imagining Steely Dan chasing the kitten instead,<br />
time out of mind but not, alas, out of joint. Oh, kitten:<br />
maybe you didn’t drop. Maybe you raptured straight up. <br />
Maybe you simply landed on your feet like, you know, a<br />
cat. Maybe I’m simply staring at the wrong bare branch. <br />
Undersexed isn’t the right word, but it doesn’t matter<br />
because I wasn’t, I’m not. Still, I’ll never have a mug<br />
that says World’s Greatest Dad. Or a kitten, or a cat.<br />
But I cling to the branch.  Persistance. Pass it on. Pass by. <br />
That beautiful highway shimmies in the sunbaked twilight.<br />
Behind the billboards, dragons dream, passed out atop bags <br />
of gold, snoring smog, imagining what life might have looked <br />
like if they’d chased a ball of yarn instead of the sublime. <br />
Imagining the sublime up a tree again, dammit,<br />
one more distraction, the goddamned stupid sublime. No, not <br />
imagining. Knowing. All those hours. Picking them out of<br />
a line-up. Telling them, one by one, to just hang in there. <br />
Where the air is rarefied, &amp; every branch is bare,<br />
&amp; the fireman on his ladder finds peace at last.<br /></p>

          <div><p><strong>Housekeeping</strong><br />
<br />
Throw your baseball cap<br />
in the dishwasher.   (This<br />
could be your son.)   Use <br />
diminutive language.   Clean<br />
the kitchen, try to get<br />
high.   Remember:   you are fascinated<br />
by repetition.   (you are<br />
a human being.<br />
              A letter comes<br />
to “DAD” from Richmond.   For fear<br />
of Federales, do not open.   It’s probably<br />
an acronym.   Instead, buy expensive<br />
underpants.   Knit a knit suitcase<br />
reinforced with discarded three-<br />
ring binders.   Swallow everything.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Explication</strong><br />
<br />
I am behind you <br />
in the stairwell<br />
explaining my <br />
absence, that I had<br />
purchased a book<br />
and would accept <br />
two more.   I appreciate <br />
value.   I will buy<br />
two toothpaste tubes <br />
for the price of one-<br />
and-a-half.   I am <br />
a happy American.<br />
I am fit enough <br />
to enjoy a little<br />
snacking.   I have <br />
a girlfriend.   I have<br />
a twelve-speed bike.<br />
My girlfriend<br />
is a twelve-speed bike.<br />
I was androgynous as a ten-<br />
year-old; I had long,<br />
beautiful eyelashes <br />
and red red lips.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Dear,</strong><br />
<br />
all of these salted<br />
crackers represent<br />
love.   jangling keys<br />
stand for consumerism<br />
and self concept:<br />
catalytic, you leave me<br />
without nexus— excited<br />
particles conform to skin<br />
of a balloon giraffe,<br />
an emptied mayonnaise jar<br />
<br />
the physical aspect of matter<br />
is a kind of honorific assigned<br />
to colliding energies— particles<br />
of space connecting space<br />
so when my sleeves give way to elbows<br />
whatever’s really going on<br />
has as much to do with being still<br />
as a swinging lamp,<br />
bleeding lotus flowers<br />
and rose-red wine.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>[How to un-do things:]</strong><br />
<br />
How to un-do things:<br />
Cut directly through<br />
the center—peel the subject’s<br />
skin, fit to something more<br />
deserving.   We are<br />
all divine, perfect images<br />
of a vengeful schizoid—<br />
There is nothing more<br />
frustrating than waiting<br />
in line at the Post Office,<br />
and little halves of books<br />
are kind and unassuming.<br />
The best customer <br />
is a repeat customer.<br />
For these many years<br />
rain’s been falling sulfur<br />
dioxide and various mono<br />
nitrogen-oxide hammers.<br />
I billow through the troposphere<br />
collecting notes for maps.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>My Body</strong><br />
<br />
Parts of me are falling off<br />
and acting like they know what’s going on.<br />
An expression of my recessive genes<br />
has appointments in two different cities,<br />
each accessible by greyhound.<br />
My nose inchworms across the carpet,<br />
encouraging comprehensive empathy<br />
for other selves I’ve met.   Not that I need<br />
reminders, really, it’s just there are<br />
so many parts. My nasopharynx wants<br />
to eat Korean noodles—the rest<br />
disagree.   I’m glad you seem to understand;<br />
I want someone who seems<br />
     to understand.<br /></p>

Street, that apartment <br />

<p>the street lights buzzing clementines <br />

drunkenly in the street <br />

Yell and drag at him  <br />

<p>half a dream, I was resigned to  <br />

A dash of freckled sun <br />
