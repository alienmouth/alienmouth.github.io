            <p>by Sara June Woods</p><br><br>
            <p><b>dear hairless chelsea,</b><br><br>
            Two women are building a house<br>
            around a dying animal.<br>
            They go to the river<br>
            &amp; dig up clay<br>
            to make into bricks<br>
            they bake in an oven.<br><br>

            The bricks stack up high.<br>
            Four, five deep.<br>
            The walls are thick.<br>
            They leave space for a window.<br>
            They leave space for a door.<br><br>

            They finish the house<br>
            &amp; the animal says<br>
            thank you so much<br>
            but I am still dying.<br><br>

            Love,<br>
            Sara</p><br><br>
            
            <p><b>dear hairless hairless tiny teacup pig playing a piano,</b><br><br>
            Your song gives me chills.<br>
            &amp; the piano you've got sounds<br>
            just like the feeling I had riding<br>
            the train into this bright city<br>
            for the first time &amp; so often since.<br>
            Where did you get your piano?<br>
            Because the notes all remind me<br>
            of people I know, people I knew,<br>
            &amp; of these beautiful intersecting lines<br>
            they draw across my field of vision,<br>
            these single words that I don't<br>
            know the meanings of, but know<br>
            the feelings of, &amp; how they move<br>
            with me when I turn my head<br>
            or walk down the street or kiss<br>
            a person other than the one<br>
            I wish I was kissing.<br><br>

            Hairless, it feels like you<br>
            are putting your whole hands<br>
            in my wounds.<br>
            It feels like a dream<br>
            about your family<br>
            where everyone dies.<br>
            One you can't stop having,<br>
            that strangers quote<br>
            at you on the street,<br>
            that is projected<br>
            on the wall<br>
            in your favorite<br>
            restaurant.<br><br>

            Pig, can we stop now?<br>
            I love your song, it's true,<br>
            I can't stop looking at it,<br>
            but I am tired of feeling for now.<br>
            Let's sleep quietly on our stomachs<br>
            &amp; hope everything's changed<br>
            by the time we wake up.<br><br>

            Love always,<br>
            Sara</p></br></br>
