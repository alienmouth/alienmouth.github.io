            <p>by Sara June Woods</p><br><br>
            <p><b>dear hairless chelsea,</b><br><br>
            Two women are building a house<br>
            around a dying animal.<br>
            They go to the river<br>
            &amp; dig up clay<br>
            to make into bricks<br>
            they bake in an oven.<br><br>

            The bricks stack up high.<br>
            Four, five deep.<br>
            The walls are thick.<br>
            They leave space for a window.<br>
            They leave space for a door.<br><br>

            They finish the house<br>
            &amp; the animal says<br>
            thank you so much<br>
            but I am still dying.<br><br>

            Love,<br>
            Sara</p><br><br>
            <p><b>dear hairless madeline,</b><br><br>
            Thank you for coming to my<br>
            uncomfortable party where everyone<br>
            was required to wear clothes<br>
            that don't fit. It was a beautiful night<br>
            &amp; I don't think that the fact that<br>
            everyone left early, or that people<br>
            took turns spitting in my drink,<br>
            even when I poured it out &amp;<br>
            got a new drink, they still kept<br>
            spitting in it, I don't think this<br>
            reflects at all on how in retrospect,<br>
            it went really well.<br><br>

            I really appreciated the dog you brought<br>
            &amp; how she was pregnant with ghosts<br>
            who just slid out of her through<br>
            her skin &amp; now they've slid into<br>
            mine. Which parts of this letter<br>
            is being written by them &amp; which<br>
            by me is anyone's guess.<br>
            I guess what I am really trying to<br>
            say is I think the party was a good<br>
            party that just kind of had to be had.<br>
            It was something we all were going<br>
            to have to go through at some time<br>
            in our lives whether or not we liked it.<br><br>

            Hairless A, I don't personally blame<br>
            your hairlessness on anything I did,<br>
            which is a huge relief for me, honestly.<br>
            I mostly blame the sense of dread that<br>
            everyone seemed to have.<br>
            The incense I was burning at the time<br>
            did say DOOMED on the package<br>
            but I assumed it was German<br>
            I assumed it meant something like<br>
            Good luck, may all of your friends<br>
            like you better than they do,<br>
            which apparently is enough to<br>
            come to a party you throw,<br>
            even one with a theme that doesn't<br>
            bode well.<br><br>

            Alice without hair, does it bother<br>
            you that I mention so often your<br>
            hairlessness? Or have you learned<br>
            to accept it in the same way the<br>
            ghosts are teaching me to accept<br>
            my hauntedness? In the same way<br>
            we all felt let down at the party?<br>
            Especially after the floor collapsed?<br>
            Killing your dog? Making one more ghost?<br>
            The priest we brought in was the color<br>
            of beautiful candy, &amp; I don't think<br>
            he was offended one bit when we<br>
            sat down with him &amp; confessed<br>
            the things that are keeping all<br>
            people from really knowing each other.<br>
            From sharing all night about<br>
            the dreams we had no matter<br>
            how much they make us cry alone<br>
            in bathrooms at work.<br><br>

            Hairless, keep with me here,<br>
            because after you left &amp; the<br>
            fire trucks arrived I got a sense<br>
            something might be wrong.<br>
            Is something wrong, or am<br>
            I just haunted? I mean I am<br>
            definitely haunted, but what<br>
            does that mean these days?<br><br>

            Anyway, thanks for hearing what<br>
            these things controlling me had<br>
            to say. I hope you're well &amp; I hope<br>
            your dog's funeral goes better<br>
            than the priest &amp; what he did<br>
            when the power went out.<br>

            All the best,<br>
            Sara</p><br><br>
            <p><b>dear hairless hairless tiny teacup pig playing a piano,</b><br><br>
            Your song gives me chills.<br>
            &amp; the piano you've got sounds<br>
            just like the feeling I had riding<br>
            the train into this bright city<br>
            for the first time &amp; so often since.<br>
            Where did you get your piano?<br>
            Because the notes all remind me<br>
            of people I know, people I knew,<br>
            &amp; of these beautiful intersecting lines<br>
            they draw across my field of vision,<br>
            these single words that I don't<br>
            know the meanings of, but know<br>
            the feelings of, &amp; how they move<br>
            with me when I turn my head<br>
            or walk down the street or kiss<br>
            a person other than the one<br>
            I wish I was kissing.<br><br>

            Hairless, it feels like you<br>
            are putting your whole hands<br>
            in my wounds.<br>
            It feels like a dream<br>
            about your family<br>
            where everyone dies.<br>
            One you can't stop having,<br>
            that strangers quote<br>
            at you on the street,<br>
            that is projected<br>
            on the wall<br>
            in your favorite<br>
            restaurant.<br><br>

            Pig, can we stop now?<br>
            I love your song, it's true,<br>
            I can't stop looking at it,<br>
            but I am tired of feeling for now.<br>
            Let's sleep quietly on our stomachs<br>
            &amp; hope everything's changed<br>
            by the time we wake up.<br><br>

            Love always,<br>
            Sara</p></br></br>
