            <p>by Sara June Woods</p><br><br>
            <p><b>dear hairless chelsea,</b><br><br>
            Two women are building a house<br>
            around a dying animal.<br>
            They go to the river<br>
            &amp; dig up clay<br>
            to make into bricks<br>
            they bake in an oven.<br><br>

            The bricks stack up high.<br>
            Four, five deep.<br>
            The walls are thick.<br>
            They leave space for a window.<br>
            They leave space for a door.<br><br>

            They finish the house<br>
            &amp; the animal says<br>
            thank you so much<br>
            but I am still dying.<br><br>

            Love,<br>
            Sara</p><br><br>
            <p><b>dear hairless madeline,</b><br><br>
            Good afternoon, you are a hairless<br>
            ocean. I wanted you to know I am<br>
            deep in your dark parts,<br>
            in a room I don't recognize except<br>
            for the cluster of all god's angels here.<br>
            Except for the sound of their<br>
            terrible coughing &amp; how it echoes<br>
            off the walls. Except for the smell<br>
            of their hair &amp; feathers, how it combines<br>
            &amp; separates inside me &amp; pulls out<br>
            old feelings I hardly recall &amp;<br>
            can only name with colors.<br>
            The angels here take turns approaching<br>
            me where I sit &amp; I hear their confessions,<br>
            the informational mistakes<br>
            in their words, yes, but also in their smell,<br>
            which I have already talked about.<br>
            I call it smell because I am dying here,<br>
            or will come back here to die.<br>
            ~eventually~.<br>
            It's s thing I found out.<br>
            or will soon.<br>
            Find out.<br><br>

            What I'm trying to say is<br>
            if we don't make wishes<br>
            they can't not come true &amp; that<br>
            I saw you across the street<br>
            while I was buying groceries &amp; I wanted to cry.<br>
            Were you carrying me in your beak then?<br>
            or is that just the shape<br>
            your face makes when you think<br>
            about the things we got to tired<br>
            to finish after we talked so well<br>
            about them.<br><br>

            Blessings,<br>
            Sara</p><br><br>
            <p><b>dear hairless hairless tiny teacup pig playing a piano,</b><br><br>
            Your song gives me chills.<br>
            &amp; the piano you've got sounds<br>
            just like the feeling I had riding<br>
            the train into this bright city<br>
            for the first time &amp; so often since.<br>
            Where did you get your piano?<br>
            Because the notes all remind me<br>
            of people I know, people I knew,<br>
            &amp; of these beautiful intersecting lines<br>
            they draw across my field of vision,<br>
            these single words that I don't<br>
            know the meanings of, but know<br>
            the feelings of, &amp; how they move<br>
            with me when I turn my head<br>
            or walk down the street or kiss<br>
            a person other than the one<br>
            I wish I was kissing.<br><br>

            Hairless, it feels like you<br>
            are putting your whole hands<br>
            in my wounds.<br>
            It feels like a dream<br>
            about your family<br>
            where everyone dies.<br>
            One you can't stop having,<br>
            that strangers quote<br>
            at you on the street,<br>
            that is projected<br>
            on the wall<br>
            in your favorite<br>
            restaurant.<br><br>

            Pig, can we stop now?<br>
            I love your song, it's true,<br>
            I can't stop looking at it,<br>
            but I am tired of feeling for now.<br>
            Let's sleep quietly on our stomachs<br>
            &amp; hope everything's changed<br>
            by the time we wake up.<br><br>

            Love always,<br>
            Sara</p></br></br>
