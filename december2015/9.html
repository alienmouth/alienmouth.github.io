            <p class = "ts" ><b>What Was It</b></p>
            <p>by Ron Gibson</p><br><br>
            <p>As I stood on the deck of a ferry, wind against my face, slicing<br>
            through dark waters under blue sky, I thought about things on the<br>
            borderlands of possible and impossible, like digitally-manipulated<br>
            art. You seemed to be all around me: in the giggles of children, in<br>
            the conversation of lovers, in the cries of hungry seagulls, as they<br>
            conducted aerial maneuvers for alms.<br><br>

            I thought about beginnings and endings, and yesterdays and nows and<br>
            tomorrows, and I could feel you there, a presence just beyond the<br>
            periphery. Everything shouted, but only I could hear your name in the<br>
            thick throats, in the sea hiss, in the engine rumble. I heard you<br>
            somewhere over the Olympic mountain range, past the mountain goats<br>
            past the snowcaps; you were where the sun lays down to die, and I<br>
            thought of you dreaming by its side, content, full of love and loved<br>
            in full.<br><br>

            Later, in the ferry terminal, I read fictional constructs from another<br>
            time, from another place, and there was a certain heat in their<br>
            fictional lives that felt familiar, that felt reflective of us,<br>
            without actually being us.<br><br>

            I tried to explain to myself what 'was,' but still could not explain<br>
            what 'is.' It was some foreign word on the tongue without translation;<br>
            a novel not yet fully conceived; it was a song yet to be heard by<br>
            ears, and it was the sonic boom that filled the skies with your<br>
            pounding heart, as metal spires loomed into view on the horizon,<br>
            growing larger and larger with your bright welcomes, until the sight<br>
            was more than any one man could take.
