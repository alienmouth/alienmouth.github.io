            <p class = "ts" ><b>Two Poems by Luis Neer</b></p>
            <b>Scattered Ashes</b> </br></br>
            Most of my life is a game of racquetball</br>
            (I can’t like any of myself).</br></br>

            This poem is a translation</br>
            from the jar of tears I never cried </br>
            after watching The Elephant Man </br>
            and gasping, seeing that John Merrick’s left hand </br>
            was the only part of his body that was not disfigured, </br>
            and thinking that its calmness was spreading </br>
            across his body </br>
            to make him radiate beauty.</br></br>

            I thought there was a poem to be found there, </br>
            but something didn’t quite fit.</br></br>

            I wanted to relate it to my own self </br>
            but I could not locate my own unscathed left hand.</br></br>

            My actual left hand bears a small white scar </br>
            from where I accidentally lacerated the tissue </br>
            when I was eight years old at my younger sister’s </br>
            birthday party; I was trying to make a mask </br>
            out of a weird kind of camouflage party hat</br>
            (the world writes its own poems).</br></br>

            I am more like a fish </br>
            in a glass bowl </br>
            that is rolling down the side of a mountain </br></br>

            and the bowl shows my reflection </br>
            and the bowl never breaks.</br></br>

            You told me that all my attributes</br>
            are more than just a fortress</br>
            to surround something rotten</br></br>

            but you are speaking to a wall</br></br>

            and I am standing </br>
            behind it.</br></br>



            <b>Motion Sickness</b></br>

            <i>after Conor Oberst</i></br></br>

            Life is not a room</br>
            People don’t just enter</br>
            through some door</br>
            drop odd objects and disappear</br>
            Everything including you</br>
            is in constant motion</br>
            The first time I died</br>
            my failed red heart had to choose</br>
            just one way to paint my body</br>
            I could have been a ballerina</br>
            spinning frantic, toppling over</br>
            into stupor</br>
            I could have been a trembling hand</br>
            I became a peeling wall</br>
            a black hole</br>
            a beacon of loneliness</br>
            became abstract fire</br>
            to warn rooms of people</br>
            avert, avert your eyes</br>
            I radiate nothing, save for</br>
            this pale beam of doubt</br>
            please don’t watch my light</br>
            that smacks the floor and shatters</br>
            I am searching for a place to feel solid</br>
            standing still before the thunderstorm</br>
            this planet holding its breath</br>
            getting dragged around the Sun</br>
