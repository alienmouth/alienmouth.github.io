            <p>It is easy to see the physical signs of someone gone:</br>
            the hairs left on pillows, the fingerprint left on a glass</br>
            left by the sink, the line etched into a wall where height</br>
            was recorded until the recorded was never going to get</br>
            any taller. It is not as easy</br></br>

            to see the smaller traces left behind: the indent in a pillow</br>
            slowly regaining its shape, the glass left in the cupboard</br>
            that won’t be drunk from again by the same lips, the lines</br>
            on faces that won’t appear because they only come with age.</br>
             It is nearly impossible</br></br>

            to see the things taken away with the one who has gone: </br>
            the color bled from hair with worry, the glass that is picked</br>
            up and set down and picked up too many times because the hands</br>
            just need to be doing something, the lines studied on the palms</br>
            of hands because your fortune never told you that this is what</br>
            would happen, that this is loss </br></br>

            and it is irrevocable. This evidence</br>
            is the evidence that does not forget because you cannot forget.</p></br>
