            <p class = "ts" ><b>punkass strawberries </br>by Jess Rizkallah</b></p>
            <p>theyve got jowls and everything. these are some punk rock strawberries</br>
            there’s a civilization in every seed and each one is yelling at the one next</br>
            door to turn down the bass &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp and the sirens &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp to end more quietly</br>
            and all delicately. and like, thematically. or something</br>
            like the end of the world will be &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp and often is</br>
            all saltwater on flesh</br></br>

            “Nearer My God To Thee” playing as the sun goes down</br> 
            it’s mouth clamping  down on our corpses</br>
            decorating the cupcake of this planet &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp cute</br></br>

            CNN will still be broadcasting, of course. they’re holding the Titanic’s final</br>
            note in a glassbottle in their database until they receive confirmation that</br>
            the world is indeed ending. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp an intern has confirmed this (we’re</br>
            good for something) (sometimes) (would you like these</br>
            stapled or paper clipped)</br></br>

            i bring my mouth down on the strawberry, getting seeds stuck between my teeth</br>
            i bare my teeth at the sun &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp pretending the red flesh is someone else’s</br></br>

            i am so totally punk rock. i don’t look the sun in the eye but</br>
            i am still so totally punk rock. i so totally feast on the jowls</br>
            of poetry and the prelude to chapstick and smoothies and</br>
            metaphor rotting in the fridge.</br></br>

            i am the sun, coming for the world. i am muting all these baby armageddons.</br>
            these berry flavored apocalypses. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp cute &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp cute cute cute &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp , &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp the end</br>

            <p class = "ts" ><b>WORKING FRIDAY NIGHTS IN HARVARD SQUARE</br>by Jess Rizkallah</b></p>
            <p>the lady ordering a latte was reading bossy pants</br>
            and i was like “hey is that book good?”</br></br>

            and she looked at me like i had seventeen fingers</br>
            attached to my left cheek because</br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp How Dare The Coffee Gnome Speak Like a Person About Person Things</br>
            and i was like YIKES OKAY MAYBE I’M NOT A PERSON AFTER ALL</br></br>

            and then she took her drink and went to sit down and unzipped</br>
            a flap in the skin of her upperarm and shoved the book inside</br>
            and i was like YIKES OKAY maybe i’m not the one who’s not human</br></br>

            and then a different lady, the woman who paints her </br>
            face purple blue blue blue glitter came in with her luggage </br>
            and her big scarf and she sits in the corner</br>
            and she is talking to someone who isn’t there and she’s doing this while</br>
            painting her face all starry night but like if van gogh had done it at the discoteque</br>
            but like if the disoteque was underwater.</br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp and she’s talking about the jazz age and also about</br>
             the fire that burned down the horsestable but also she’s really not able</br>
            to stomach dairy this week and she doesn’t know what to do about it</br>
            because being lactose intolerant is becoming an expensive trend in this college town</br>
            but also HEY YOU &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp YOU  WITH THE MOTOROLA </br>
            WAITING FOR YOUR COFFEE &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp YEAH YOU I SEE YOU</br>   
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp YOURE NOT TAKING ME ANYWHERE</br>
            I DONT EVEN HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE AND IM SICK</br>
            OF THIS 1984 SHIT &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I WISH YOU’D ALL JUST LEAVE ME ALONE</br></br>

            OR AT LEAST SPOT ME 22 FUCKING CENTS</br></br>

            and she turns to her ghost friend and sobs, she is sobbing and then</br>
            she is medusa’s mouth again, snakes coming out of the cranium</br>
            of every word she says, she says one day &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp one day one day one</br>
            day one day one day one day one day</br>
            one day one day one day</br>
            one day one day one day one day</br>
            one day one day the the entire world will be</br>
            blue and people will be nice and maybe. maybe</br>
            she is the most Person person here</br>
            </p></br>
            <p class = "ts" ><b>the summer i keep yelling</br>by Jess Rizkallah</b></p>
            <p>i’ve swallowed all the elephants in the room,
            they hide under sheets like i can’t see them
            but i know they’re there. there’s a tiny dancing man
            making coffee somewhere between my elbow
            and my chest emoji. he back and forths
            to collect the magic beans scattered where i creak

            i’ve started yelling about capitalism in the kitchen
            i do this by yelling CAPITALISM!!!! in the kitchen
            sam tells me to stop yelling un-popped punk at her
            and marisa tells me to stop reading Pinsky.
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Pinsky uses his indoor voice
            and i think about how it will still always be louder than my outdoor voice
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp so now i am busting down the doors in my mouth       
            the same way i am always busting open follicles 
            to get to the caffeine of myself
            where the tiny man dances

            while tiny man works, his third eye puts an ear to my chest and hums along
            i don’t have to tell him how much i love him or that it weirds me out
            that i do or that i know his voice like skin that traps an ingrown hair
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp like something that’s part of me, something i could also rip out, something 
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp with eyelashes the same length as mine

            i don’t know where i live anymore but i’ve started falling
            asleep, bottlecap charging in my palms. i am soaking up
            cosmic energy to phone the ambivalent space booger.
            i need to ask the Moon a thing. i need to ask it what to do
            when people keep leaving? &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp when they’re actually
            planets hatching from human suits. i need to ask how i too
            can become a planet. or a non planet &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp or an old cassette,
            or something like a hatchet to the gravitational pull
            between scars when scars match up. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp still ringing

            so i ask sam instead and she tells me that when the kid upstairs runs,
            dust falls from the ceiling. her ivy plant covered with the slap of baby feet.

            i leave the bottlecap upside down by my bed to catch more
            it’s always empty in the morning &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp so i feed it to the elephants
            and they tremble &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp their nails are upside down shot glasses
            cracking under the weight of the espresso that the tiny man in my chest
            is stacking every time i feel a thing. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp every time i close doors
            instead of busting them open &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp i am running out of rooms.

            i wake up next to a notebook open like a wound
            one centimeter to the left of mine so i’ll never write it
            down just right even when i finally can and so     
            i’m yelling in the kitchen &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp i’m busting open follicles,     
            i want the scars lined up   and they tell me to stop yelling    
            to use my indoor voice &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp to stop using hammers instead of keys        
            they want me to leave the room

            and there is caffeine everywhere &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspi am leaking magic beans
            and the tiny man is riding the elephants out of my chest
            he wants me to look them in the eye &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp but their eyelashes
            are too thick. they look like mine
