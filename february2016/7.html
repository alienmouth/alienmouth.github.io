            <p class = "ts" ><b>2 Poems</b></p>
            <p>by Johnny Kiosk</p><br><br>
            <p><b>the elder scrolls</b><br><br>
            the part in oblivion<br>
            where you go into the painting<br>
            and you have to fight the painted trolls<br>
            but you don’t have enough turpentine arrows to defeat them<br>
            so you run up a hill<br>
            and try to cast fireballs at them<br>
            but their health regenerates too quickly<br>
            because the leveling up system is broken<br>
            and bethesda realized this and fixed it in skyrim<br>
            but you aren’t playing skyrim<br>
            and now the trolls have murdered you<br>
            that’s what it feels like not talking to you</p><br><br>
            <p><b>cheat code</b><br><br>
            not feeling very motivated<br>
            not feeling very challenged by life<br>
            because i live in my childhood bedroom<br>
            this is life on easy mode<br>
            you can’t get the best ending on easy mode<br>
            i don’t care about endings or beginnings or the middle<br>
            mature people take coffee breaks at starbucks near their places of work while talking to other working people about work<br>
            they write short non emotional emails that refer to the contents of spreadsheets or other emails<br>
            they do this for forty to fifty years<br>
            i stare at a screen and wait for the internet to tell me what emotion to experience next<br>
            there is a gigantic hole in my mind that information technology plugs up<br>
            i try to imagine myself feeling worked up enough about life to scream silently in my head for three hours but i don’t<br>
            i would flush this poem down the toilet but it’s on my macbook and that won’t fit down the toilet even if i shatter it first<br>
            so instead i just stare at it and try to subtract any emotion­inducing lines or words out of it because aren’t we past that stuff by now<br>
            imagine seagulls flying toward the sunset growing and expanding into Salvador Dali type creatures dripping liquid clocks over parked cars and pedestrians while humming chopin's nocturnes<br>
            would that be beautiful?<br>
            i don’t know what is beautiful<br>
            this poem is an exegesis on continental philosophy and aesthetics<br>
            beautiful things disappear as you approach them<br>
            my computer is telling me not to get a job<br>
            i tell it ok<br>
            i feel better for a little while and then don’t</p></br></br></br>
