            <p class = "ts" ><b>3 Poems</b></p>
            <p>by Carolyn DeCarlo</p><br><br>
            <p><b>Circulars</b></p>
            <p>Upstairs, the one legged man taps on the floor<br>
            and I think it is someone knocking at our door.<br>
            Sometimes when I am lying in bed<br>
            I can hear him in the toilet.<br>
            Our flats are laid out backward.<br>
            His lounge is above my bedroom,<br>
            his bedroom below our lounge.<br>
            The kitchens are in completely different places.<br>
            Once, Jackson said he could hear the <br>
            one legged man peeing while he was peeing.<br><br>

            The one legged man leaves his newspapers on the footpath<br>
            and his junk mail in the mailbox.<br>
            We bring his junk mail down to him<br>
            and put it on his barbecue,<br>
            but it just ends up blowing around<br>
            on our steps and getting caught out in the rain.<br><br>

            The one legged man stays home a lot.<br>
            He watches a lot of movies and<br>
            gets his food delivered from Countdown.<br>
            The one legged man keeps his door open <br>
            but I’ve only seen him once.<br>
            The day we moved in,<br>
            I knocked on his door frame.<br>
            He came out and introduced himself.<br>
            He said he likes to play music<br>
            and we should tell him off if it gets too loud.<br>
            The one legged man’s music is never too loud<br>
            but it’s not enjoyable either.<br><br>

            The one legged man has two cats.<br>
            They are both incredibly shy.<br>
            One of them accepts pats<br>
            but the other one will hide under the house <br>
            if he sees you coming.<br>
            One time, I sat down on the couch<br>
            and the shy cat shot out from behind it<br>
            and ran out the door.<br>
            The one legged man seems nice enough.<br>
            We borrowed his can opener once.</p></br></br></br>
            <p><b>Circulars</b></p>
            <p>I tie a thread around my ankles</br>
            and lower my body down</br>
            beneath the deck</br>
            to watch the cats with human faces</br>
            clean themselves in the half-light</br>
            of their homes.</br></br>

            A zeppelin disguised as a kereru</br>
            propels itself magnificently</br>
            through the stratosphere overhead</br>
            and my person-eyes are transfixed</br>
            by the person-eyes in front of mine,</br>
            set in their frame of orange fur.</br></br>

            How far back does the person go,</br>
            I wonder –</br>
            as in, are they person-brains or cat-brains</br>
            living inside?</br>
            Their homes are so clean,</br>
            pitched roofs and whitewashed boards</br>
            fitted snug to the land,</br>
            the gentle roll of the hill.</br>
            It is hard to hold onto them,</br>
            hard to keep sight of their scale</br>
            as we tap dance on the lino </br>
            above their heads.</p></br></br></br>
            <p><b>Circulars</b></p>
            <p>Trees march down the window </br>
            panes </br>
            of all the apartment buildings</br>
            in straight diagonal lines.</br></br>

            A woman peers through the plants</br>
            in her window</br>
            and smiles as you pass.</br></br>

            Smile back.</br></br>

            A foot appears in the gutter,</br>
            lonely,</br>
            pierced by a metal rod.</br></br>

            Pick it up and </br>
            place it in your bag.</p></br></br></br>
